      Release 4-29</h2>
    <h2>
      February 17, 2016</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Revert the change made in R4-27 to drvAsynIPPortConfigure that changed the noProcessEos
      flag to userFlags. The final argument to drvAsynIPPortConfigure is now noProcessEos
      again.</li>
    <li>Implemented the asynOption interface which allows configuring options using key/value
      pairs. This interface is used in the drvAsynSerialPort driver for configuring baud
      rate, stop bits, etc. It is also used on drvAsynIPPort for configuring these same
      items if the port was configured with the COM qualifier, used for Ethernet/Serial
      terminal servers that use the TELNET RFC 2217 protocol. For that drvAsynIPPort uses
      the asynInterposeCOM to interpose the asynOctet and asynOption interfaces.</li>
    <li>drvAsynIPPort now also directly supports the asynOption interface for 2 key/value
      pairs.
      <ul>
        <li>key="disconnectOnReadTimeout", value="Y" or "N". This option replaces the USERFLAG_CLOSE_ON_READ_TIMEOUT
          that was introduced in R4-27. The advantage of using the asynOption interface is
          that this behavior can now be changed at run-time, rather than being set once when
          the driver is created.</li>
        <li>key="hostInfo", value="host:port[:localport] [protocol]", i.e. the Internet host
          name, port number, optional local port number and optional protocol. This uses the
          same syntax as the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command. This allows changing at run time
          the Internet host and port to which this asyn port is connected. The only restriction
          is that the setting of the COM (TELNET RFC 2217) protocol cannot be changed from
          that specified with drvAsynIPPortConfigure. This is because if COM is specified
          in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command then asynOctet and asynOption interpose interfaces
          are used, and asynManager does not support removing interpose interfaces.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Improved debugging output with ASYN_TRACEIO_DRIVER. Previously there was no asynTrace
      output if recv() or recvfrom() returned &le;0. It is often useful to know if these
      functions returned 0, so the asynTrace output is now only suppressed if these functions
      return &lt;0.<br />
      There was previously no ASYN_TRACEIO_DRIVER output from the flushIt() function,
      which repeatedly calls recv() until the return value is &le;0. ASYN_TRACEIO_DRIVER
      will now print a message with the total number of bytes flushed in this function,
      if the number is greater than 0.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added 2 new record fields to read and control the new drvAsynIPPort options:
      <ul>
        <li>DRTO (Disconnect on Read Timeout)</li>
        <li>HOSTINFO (hostInfo string)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added new OPI screen (asynIPPortSetup.[adl,.opi,.edl,.ui]). This screen allows
      display and control of the new DRTO and HOSTINFO fields. It also allows display
      and control of the serial port parameters for drvAsynIPPorts created with the COM
      (RFC 2217) protocol. There was previously no GUI to control these options for IP
      ports. This screen is accessed via the More menu in asynRecord.adl.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add paramName to error messages for easier debugging.</li>
    <li>Throw exception if NULL pointer is passed to setStringParam().</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>asynTrace now does flush after each write on files, previously it only did this
      on stdin and stderr. This prevents trace information in files being lost if the
      application crashes.</li>
    <li>Fixed syntax of call to cantProceed().</li>
    <li>Added definition of ASYN_EXCEPTION_STRINGS which provides strings corresponding
      to each asynException enum value.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    testBroadcastApp</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new test application testBroadcastBurst. This application periodically sends
      a burst of broadcast packets. The number of packets per burst and the interval between
      bursts can be specified on the command line. It is useful for testing devices to
      see how tolerant they are of broadcast bursts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    testConnectApp</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added missing extern "C" required to build dynamically on Windows.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Many source files</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Replaced tab characters with spaces. Tabs in source files are bad practice.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 4-28</h2>
    <h2>
      December 12, 2015</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed problem with UDP broadcast sockets. Previously sending broadcast messages
    worked correctly, but any responses from clients to those messages were rejected
    by the IOC system. This is because connect() and send() were being called. This
    is not correct, in this case connect() should not be called and sendto() should
    be called rather than send(). Also changed the code to call recvfrom() rather than
    recv()for UDP sockets. This returns the source address information, which is now
    printed with the source message length and contents if ASYN_TRACEIO_DRIVER is set.</p>
  <h3>
    Test applications</h3>
  <p>
    New test application, testOutputReadbackApp. Tests that the initial values of output
    records are set correctly.</p>
  <p>
    New test application directory, testBroadcastApp. It has 2 applications for sending
    broadcasts and reading responses. One uses asyn, and the other native OS calls.
    The native OS call version only builds on Linux. This is used for testing the UDP
    broadcast problem fixed in this release.</p>

  <h3>
    Repository location</h3>
  <p>
    The source code repository was moved from <a href="https://svn.aps.anl.gov/epics/asyn">
      https://svn.aps.anl.gov/epics/asyn</a> to <a href="https://github.com/epics-modules/asyn">
        https://github.com/epics-modules/asyn</a>. This will make it much easier for
    others to collaborate in the development of asyn.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix to save the previous values of the baud rate and termios structures before
      attempting to change them. If the change fails then the previous values are restored.
      Previously if a call to setOption() failed, then subsequent calls to getOption()
      would return the value that failed. Now subsequent calls to getOption() will return
      the previous valid option, which is presumably the one that the underlying OS driver
      is still using. Thanks to Ron Sluiter for the initial fix to this problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortWin32</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix to automatically prefix COM port names with "\\.\" unless the port name already
      begins with "\\.\". This is valid syntax for all COM ports and is required for all
      ports except COM1-COM9. Note that when passing the port string from the iocsh if
      the port name is in quotes then backslash characters should not be escaped, e.g.
      "\\.\COM10". If the port name is not in quotes then the backslash characters must
      be escaped, e.g. \\\\.\\COM10. Thanks to Freddie Akeroyd for the initial version
      of this fix.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added the option to automatically close the port when there is a read timeout.
      This was done by changing the syntax of the drvAsynIPConfigure command from<br />
      <code>drvAsynIPPortConfigure("portName","hostInfo",priority,noAutoConnect,noProcessEos)</code>
      to
      <br />
      <code>drvAsynIPPortConfigure("portName","hostInfo",priority,noAutoConnect,userFlags)</code><br />
      userFlags: bit-wise ORed:
      <ul>
        <li>Bit 0 is USERFLAG_NO_PROCESS_EOS. If 0 then asynInterposeEosConfig is called specifying
          both processEosIn and processEosOut. </li>
        <li>Bit 1 is USERFLAG_CLOSE_ON_READ_TIMEOUT. If 1 then the (TCP) socket will be closed
          when read() returns a timeout. </li>
        <li>Bit 2--31 are reserved, set to zero. </li>
      </ul>
      This change is backwards compatible since bit 0 is the same as the previous noProcessEos.
      Thanks to Torsten Bogershausen for this change. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed error reporting if pasynManager->queueRequest returned an error. Previously
      error messages were printed on every call, which would cause a large number of messages
      if the port was disconnected and records were periodically processing. Now an error
      message is only printed when the status return from pasynManager->queueRequest changes,
      so there will be single message for each record when a port disconnects and a single
      message when it reconnects.</li>
    <li>Changed error handling when any of the following errors are encountered:
      <ul>
        <li>pasynManager->queueRequest returns an error</li>
        <li>The I/O call to the driver (e.g. pasynInt32->read()) returns an error.</li>
        <li>The interrupt callback function is passed an error code in pasynUser->auxStatus</li>
      </ul>
      Previously such errors did correctly set the record alarm status and severity. However,
      they did not return an error code to the function that called the device support
      write() or read() function. They also updated the record VAL or RVAL field when
      there was an error, which they should not. Now these functions return an error code
      and do not update VAL or RVAL when there is an error. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed the status return from pasynManager->queueRequest from asynError to asynDisconnected
      if a port with ASYN_CANBLOCK=0 is disconnected.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynShellCommands</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new command asynSetMinTimerPeriod, and corresponding C function. This command
      is currently only implemented on the WIN32 architectures, and simply prints an error
      message on all other architectures. It allows reducing the minimum time for epicsThreadSleep()
      from the default of 10 ms to the minimum supported Windows system value. On most
      systems this is 1 ms. Note that epicsThreadSleepQuantum() does not seem to report
      the correct value whether or not this function is called. On my system it always
      reports 0.0156 seconds. Note also that this function really has nothing to do with
      asyn, and the equivalent functionality should probably be moved into EPICS base
      at some time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Deadlock issue</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a potential deadlock issue when using input records with SCAN=I/O Intr.
      This is discussed in the <a href="KnownProblems.html">KnownProblems document</a>.
      Thanks to Ambroz Bizjak for finding this problem.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 4-26</h2>
    <h2>
      February 15, 2015</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added capability for output records to update their values with a callback from
      the driver. This is enabled by adding the following info tag to the output record:<br />
      <code>info(asyn:READBACK, "1")</code><br />
      The output record value will update any time the driver does a callback with a new
      value. The output record alarm status and severity will also update to reflect the
      value passed by the driver in pasynUser->auxStatus. The driver callbacks use the
      same ring buffer mechanism that input records do. The default ring buffer size is
      10 for all records except stringin, stringout, and waveform records, for which the
      default is 0.</li>
    <li>Updated the test application testErrorsApp to demonstrate and test output record
      updates.</li>
    <li>Added ring buffer support to devAsynOctet. The default ring buffer size is 0 for
      all records in devAsynOctet, i.e. stringin, stringout, waveform in and out. Non-zero
      values can be specified with the asyn:FIFO info tag.</li>
    <li>Changed the info tag that is used to control the size of the ring buffer for driver
      callbacks. The tag has been changed from FIFO to asyn:FIFO, i.e. adding the asyn:
      namespace to prevent future conflicts with any other facility. <em>NOTE:</em>This
      change is not backwards compatible, any databases using the FIFO info tag will need
      to be changed to asyn:FIFO. It is not expected that this will affect many users,
      since the default ring buffer size is used in nearly all cases.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bug fix: If setParamStatus() was called for an array or generic pointer parameter
      then callParamCallbacks() could return prematurely and not do the callbacks for
      all modified parameters.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 4-25</h2>
    <h2>
      December 10, 2014</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    devAsynOctet</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed 2 bugs:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The interrupt callback function for stringin records (e.g. with SCAN=I/O Intr)
      did not null-terminate the string if the driver returned MAX_STRING_SIZE or more
      characters. Thanks to Freddie Akeroyd for fixing this.</li>
    <li>The interrupt callback function for stringin and waveform records were not properly
      locking the record when modifying the record fields.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    devAsynXXXArray</h3>
  <p>
    Added optional support for ring buffers with waveform records. Ring buffers were
    added to asyn device support for scalar (non-array) records in R4-10. To enable
    ring buffer support on a waveform record the record info tag FIFO can be set to
    a value greater than 0. For example this line in a db file for a waveform record
    sets a ring buffer size of 20 elements.</p>
  <pre>       info("FIFO", "20") 
    </pre>
  <p>
    Ring buffers are only used when records have SCAN=I/O Intr. They allow the record
    to process all of the arrays from a rapid burst of callbacks from the driver. However,
    because Channel Access does not provide any buffering for arrays, even if the record
    processes for each new array callback, Channel Access will not necessarily send
    events for each value, because it just sends the current record value when the CA
    callbacks are done.</p>
  <p>
    A new test application, testArrayRingBufferApp was added to test this array ring
    buffer support. A new iocBoot/ioctestRingBuffer directory was also added.</p>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added new asynOptionSyncIO interface. This interface is needed so that the asynOption
    interface can be called synchronously when it is OK to block.</p>
  <h3>
    Building asyn with only using libCom from EPICS base</h3>
  <p>
    It has always been asserted that except for devEpics asyn only really depends on
    libCom from EPICS base. People who are interested in using asyn drivers from other
    control systems, want to minimize the dependencies of libraries from EPICS base.
    The following lines have been added to asyn/configure/CONFIG_SITE:</p>
  <pre>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you want to build asyn so the only dependency on EPICS base is libCom then set the following flag
#EPICS_LIBCOM_ONLY=YES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
  <p>
    If EPICS_LIBCOM_ONLY is YES then the build is done so that only libCom is needed.
    This does the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Omits building all of the device support for EPICS records</li>
    <li>Omits building the test applications that create IOC applications</li>
    <li>Sets asyn_LIBS to Com rather than $(EPICS_BASE_IOCS_LIBS) when creating the library</li>
    <li>Changes the logic in asynPortDriver which uses interruptAccept. If EPICS_LIBCOM_ONLY
      is set then dbDefs.h is not included and interruptAccept is defined as a static
      variable set to 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A new C++ class was added, asyn/asynPortClient/asynPortClient.cpp. This class makes
    it easy to write a C++ application that starts existing asyn port drivers and communicates
    with them over standard asyn interfaces without running an IOC.</p>
  <p>
    A new test application directory was added testAsynPortClient. This tests running
    C++ applications that communicate with asyn port drivers without running an IOC.
    This currently contains a single test application, testAsynIPPortClient.cpp. This
    program creates an asynIPPort driver, and uses the command line arguments to set
    the hostInfo string, a single command string to send to the server, and optionally
    the input and output EOS. It then prints out the response from the server. There
    are 3 example shell scipts that show how to use testAsynIPPortClient to communicate
    with a Web server, XPS motor controller, and a telnet host respectively.<br />

  <h3>
    drvAsynUSBTMC</h3>
  <p>
    Bruno Martins found and fixed a problem with data transfers that spanned multiple
    USB packets.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-24</h2>
    <h2>
      October 14, 2014</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort.c</h3>
  <p>
    Added capability to specify the local port that the server should use for the connection.
    Normally the local host choses a random local port that it binds to and passes to
    the server. There are a few servers that only accept a specific local port or range
    of local ports, for which this capability is required. The new syntax is:</p>
  <p>
    &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[:localPort] [protocol]</p>
  <p>
    For example</p>
  <p>
    164.54.160.100:5000:10101 UDP</p>
  <p>
    where 10101 is the optional local port number.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed all initialization routines so that if there is an error they do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Call recGblSetSevr(precord,LINK_ALARM,INVALID_ALARM)</li>
    <li>Set precord-&gt;pact=1</li>
    <li>return(INIT_ERROR), where INIT_ERROR=-1</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Thanks to Nick Rees for these fixes.</p>
  <h3>
    Many source files</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed problem with location of #define epicsExportSharedSymbols and/or #include
    &lt;epicsExport.h&gt;. In previous versions these were placed immediately before
    the #include statements defining symbols for that <em>source file</em> . However,
    this was incorrect, they must be placed before all of the #include statements defining
    symbols <em>for that DLL</em> . This mistake causes the same symbol being defined
    with both dllExport and dllImport when building the DLL. The Visual Studio compiler
    does not even warn about this error, but it produces a fatal error with the GCC
    compiler under Cygwin.</p>

  <h3>
    asynManager.c</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in pasynManager-&gt;memMalloc. It could return a pointer that was not
    a multiple of 8 bytes. This led to subtle problems on some architectures (e.g. ARM)
    if a double was stored in the memory returned by memMalloc. Fixed the code so the
    pointer is always a multiple of 16 bytes (for future safety).</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynUSBTMC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added driver for USB TMC (Test and Measurement Class) devices.</li>
    <li>Works on any system that provides <a href="http://libusb.info">libusb-1.0</a>.</li>
    <li>Requires no kernel modifications.</li>
    <li>Tested with StreamDevice on Darwin, Linux and Windows.</li>
    <li>Enabled by setting DRV_USBTMC=YES in configure/CONFIG_SITE.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug: the port was not always being disconnected when the OS returned serious
    errors. This was preventing USB serial devices from disconnecting and reconnecting
    properly.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortWin32 (Windows serial port driver)</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed 2 bugs in pasynOctet-&gt;read() when pasynUserTimeout=0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It was not returning immediately, it was waiting 16 ms.</li>
    <li>If there were no characters to be read it was not returning asynTimeout, it was
      returning asynSuccess. This prevented StreamDevice from working correctly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed several 32/64 bit issues.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPServerPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for UDP servers, in addition to TCP servers. Thanks to Helge Brands
    and Dirk Zimoch from PSI for this.</p>
  <h3>
    drvLinuxGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fix to Makefile to link with system libgpib library.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics (asynInt32)</h3>
  <p>
    Sign-extend positive or unsigned values as well as negative values when DTYP=asynInt32
    and asynMask value is non-zero.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics (asynUInt32Digital)</h3>
  <p>
    Apply mask to longin and longout records.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Undid the change in R4-22 that changed the asynStdInterfaces from protected to private.
    That change was not compatible with areaDetector R1-9-1.</p>
  <p>
    Removed paramList.h and paramList.cpp, put the code into asynPortDriver.cpp. These
    two classes had many interdependencies, so needed to include each other's header
    files. This was difficult when building dynamically on Windows, where imported and
    exported symbols need to be distinguished.</p>
  <p>
    Added links to asynPortDriver.html to detailed tutorial on how to write a driver
    using asynPortDriver.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug that could cause the values of *nbytesOut, *nbytesIn, and *eomReason
    to be garbage if an I/O error occurred.</p>
  <h3>
    Many files</h3>
  <p>
    Handled exporting symbols consistently, which is important when building dynamically
    for Windows with Visual Studio. Eliminated all references to epicsSharedSymbols,
    now just #include &lt;epicsexport.h&gt; just before the #include for the header
    file that defines symbols for this file, and after all other #include statements.
    Thanks to Peter Heesterman for the initial version of this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    configure directory</h3>
  <p>
    Updated the files in the configure directory to the versions from EPICS base 3.14.12.3.
    Paths to EPICS base and other modules are still defined in configure/RELEASE. However,
    other configuration values, such as LINUX_GPIB and DRV_USBTMC are now defined in
    configure/CONFIG_SITE, not in RELEASE.</p>

    <h2>
      October 30, 2013</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support functions for setting timestamps in asyn port drivers. These can be
    used to set the timestamp when the port driver received data. The driver can then
    set the asynUser-&gt;timeStamp field to this value for all input records on read
    and callback operations. Records that have TSE=-2 will have this timestamp. There
    is support for registering a user-supplied function to provide the timestamp, which
    will override the default source that just calls epicsTimeGetCurrent().
  </p>
  <p>
    Added the following new functions to pasynManager for timestamp support.</p>
  <pre>asynStatus (*registerTimeStampSource)(asynUser *pasynUser, void *userPvt, timeStampCallback callback);
asynStatus (*unregisterTimeStampSource)(asynUser *pasynUser);
asynStatus (*updateTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser);
asynStatus (*getTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser, epicsTimeStamp *pTimeStamp);
asynStatus (*setTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser, const epicsTimeStamp *pTimeStamp);
</pre>
  <p>
    Added the following shell commands for timestamp support.</p>
  <pre>asynRegisterTimeStampSource(const char *portName, const char *functionName);
asynUnregisterTimeStampSource(const char *portName);
   </pre>
  <p>
    Added a new bit to asynTraceMask, ASYN_TRACE_WARNING. This is intended to be used
    for messages that are less serious than ASYN_TRACE_ERROR, but more serious than
    ASYN_TRACE_FLOW.</p>
  <p>
    Added new asynTraceInfoMask. This mask controls the information printed at the beginning
    of each message by asynPrint and asynPrintIO. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen for help
    with this. The mask is defined with the following bits:</p>
  <pre>#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_TIME 0x0001
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_PORT 0x0002
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_SOURCE 0x0004
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_THREAD 0x0008
    </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_TIME prints what has been printed in previous versions of asyn,
      the date and time of the message.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_PORT prints [port,addr,reason], where port is the port name, addr
      is the asyn address, and reason is pasynUser-&gt;reason. These are the 3 pieces
      of "addressing" information in asyn.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_SOURCE prints the file name and line number, i.e. [__FILE__,__LINE__]
      where the asynPrint statement occurs.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_THREAD prints the thread name, thread ID and thread priority, i.e.
      [epicsThreadGetNameSelf(), epicsThreadGetIdSelf(), epicsThreadGetPrioritySelf()].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Added a new shell command to control this mask.</p>
  <pre>    asynSetTraceInfoMask port,addr,mask
    </pre>
  <p>
    Added asynTrace information to the output of asynReport if details &gt;=1.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO</h3>
  <p>
    Use simple lock/unlock operations rather than queueLockPort/queueUnlockPort for
    end-of-string manipulations (setInputEos, getInputEos, setOutputEos, getOutputEos).
    This ensures that these operations can take place even with the device disconnected.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Finished the support for setting the record TIME field for input records, both for
    read operations and for callback operations (i.e. records with SCAN=I/O Intr). This
    work was begun in R4-20, but it was not complete. Fixes were made in devAsynOctet,
    devAsynInt32, devAsynFloat64, and devAsynUInt32Digital.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the ring buffer overflow messages that are printed in devAsynInt32, devAsynFloat64,
    and devAsynUInt32Digital. These now use the new ASYN_TRACE_WARNING mask. Prior to
    asyn R4-20 these used ASYN_TRACE_ERROR, and in asyn R4-20 and R4-21 they used ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in calling poll(). Previously the status return from poll() was not
    being checked; it was assumed that when poll() returned the port either had new
    data or had timed out. This is not correct, because poll() can return prematurely
    with errno=EINTR if a Posix signal occurs before data is received or the timeout
    expires. This can happen, for example, when the Posix high-resolution timer routines
    (timer_create, etc.) are used in the IOC. The Prosilica vendor library uses the
    Posix timer routines, and there were problems using asyn IP ports in IOCs that were
    also running Prosilica cameras. The problem was fixed by calling poll() again if
    it returns EINTR and the desired timeout time has not expired since poll() was first
    called.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for AF_UNIX sockets on systems that provide them.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Support for all baud rates supported by the operating system.</p>
  <p>
    Fix for XON/XOFF support from Dirk Zimoch.</p>
  <h3>
    Changes to work with EPICS base 3.15</h3>
  <p>
    Removed include of asyn.dbd, from drvAsynSerialPort.dbd, drvAsynIPPort.dbd, drvVxi11.dbd,
    and drvGsIP488.dbd.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fixed Makefile rule for vxi11intr.h for parallel builds.</p>
  <h3>
    drvLinuxGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fixes for eomReason and EOS handling from Dirk Zimoch.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO interface</h3>
  <p>
    Removed the openSocket() function from this interface. This method really did not
    belong in this interface, since it just wrapped the call to drvAsynIPPortConfigure().</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Added 4 additional baud rates to the BAUD field (460800, 576000, 921600, 1152000).
    However, the BAUD field can still only support 16 fixed baud rates because it is
    type DBF_ENUM.</p>
  <p>
    Added a new LBAUD (long baud rate) field of type DBF_LONG. This allows selection
    of any baud rate, not just those in the BAUD menu. Changing the BAUD field changes
    the LBAUD field. Changing the LBAUD field changes the BAUD field to the appropriate
    selection if it is a supported value, or to "Unknown" if not.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for ASYN_TRACE_WARNING and asynTraceInfoMask, including the opi screens.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added new virtual methods to support Eos operations on the asynOctet interface.
    These are setInputEosOctet(), getInputEosOctet(), setOutputEosOctet(), getOutputEosOctet().
    Changed the report() method to print the current values of the inputEos and outputEos.</p>
  <p>
    Added new virtual methods for timestamp support. These are updateTimeStamp(), setTimeStamp(),
    getTimeStamp().</p>
  <p>
    Added new function getAsynStdInterfaces() to access the asynStdInterfaces structure,
    which is now private.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changed the functions that do callbacks when callParamCallbacks() is called to call
    pasynManager-&gt;getTimeStamp() and set the pasynUser-&gt;timestamp field to this
    value in the callbacks.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the base class readXXX() functions (e.g. readInt32(), readFloat64(), etc.)
    to call pasynManager-&gt;getTimeStamp() and set the pasynUser-&gt;timestamp field
    to this value. The readXXX() functions in derived classes should also do this, so
    that records with TSE=-2 will get the timestamp from the driver.</p>
  <h3>
    testErrorApp, iocTestErrors</h3>
  <p>
    Added an example of a user-supplied timestamp source.</p>
  <h3>
    testAsynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added calls to lock() and unlock() in simTask. This was previously a serious omission
    in this example driver. Thanks to Kay Kasemir for spotting this.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <hr />
    <h2>
      Release 4-21</h2>
    <h2>
      February 18, 2013</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Restored the original versions of pasynManager-&gt;lockPort and unlockPort that
    were used in asyn prior to R4-14. These versions just call epicsMutexLock and epicsMutexUnlock.
    In R4-14 these versions were replaced with versions that queued requests to lock
    the port. The R4-14 versions fixed a problem with the interfaces/asynXXXSyncIO functions,
    but it has become clear that the original versions are useful in some circumstances.
    The change was done as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The lockPort and unlockPort functions in R4-20 were renamed to pasynManager-&gt;queueLockPort
      and queueUnlockPort.</li>
    <li>The interfaces/asynXXXSyncIO functions were all changed to call the queueLockPort
      and queueUnlockPort, so they function identically to how they have since R4-14.</li>
    <li>The versions of lockPort and unlockPort that existed prior to R4-14 were restored
      to pasynManager.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Changed the report() function so that if details&lt;0 then asynManager does not
    print information for each device (address). It calls pasynCommon-&gt;report(-details)
    in this case so driver report functions will not be affected.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the asynTrace print, printIO, vprint, vprintIO functions so they use EPICS_PRINTF_STYLE.
    This causes the GCC (version 3.0 and higher) and clang compilers to check the agreement
    of format strings with function arguments when using asynPrint() and asynPrintIO(),
    just as they do with printf(). This is very helpful in finding errors, and uncovered
    a number in asyn itself, which have been fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Changed event code readback to support both the original 'short' VAL field (EPICS
    3.14 and earlier) and the new 'string' VAL field (EPICS 3.15 and later).</p>
  <p>
    Added support for DSET_AIRAW and DSET_AORAW definitions.</p>
  <p>
    Replace strcpy with strncpy in devCommonGpib.c to reduce possibility of errors.
    Use NELEMENTS macro in devSkeletonGpib.c rather than hardcoding. Thanks to Andrew
    Johnson for these.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Improved the initMbboDirect function in devAsynUInt32Digital.c. If an initial value
    is read successfully from the driver it now sets the .Bn fields in the record. It
    also sets VAL rather than RVAL and returns 2 rather than 0. Thanks to Andrew Johnson
    for this.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in devAsynUInt32Digital.c, which was missing a call to epicsMutexLock
    in interruptCallbackInput. Thanks to Angus Gratton for this fix.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in devAsynXXXArray.h to handle case of multiple interrupt callbacks
    between record processing. Previously this would result in a call to the asynXXXArray-&gt;read()
    in the driver, which is not correct. The asynXXXArray device support does not have
    a ring buffer, so multiple interrupt callbacks between processing results in data
    being "lost", i.e. the record processes more than once with the same data. This
    is not really an error, but we now issue an ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE warning. This is
    analogous to ring buffer overflow for non-array data types.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the "ring buffer overflow" messages from "ASYN_TRACE_ERROR" to "ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE",
    for devAsynFloat64. This was done for other device support in R4-20, but float64
    was overlooked.</p>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added writeRead and writeReadOnce functions to the asynGenericPointer interface.
    Thanks to Florian Feldbauer for this addition.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in asynCommonSyncIO that could cause a crash if the connect() function
    returned an error.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the asynOption interface. Added code to demonstrate and test this
    to the testErrors test application.</p>
  <p>
    Added new method asynPortDriver::flushOctet(), which implements asynOctet::flush().
    The base class implementation reproduces the behavior of asynOctetBase.c::flushIt,
    i.e. it calls pasynOctet-&gt;read() repeatedly with a timeout of 0.05 seconds until
    it gets no data back. But now drivers can implement their own version of flush()
    if a different behavior is desired, which was not previously possible.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the code so that the length of string parameters returned in readOctet and
    octetCallback is now strlen(string)+1, rather than strlen(string). The length thus
    now includes the terminating nil. This fixes problems with clients that request
    long strings or subscribe to monitors with a length of 0, but don't check for a
    nil terminator.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the meaning of the "details" argument in the asynPortDriver::report() function.
    The new meaning is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 = no details</li>
    <li>&gt;=1: print details for parameter list (address) 0</li>
    <li>&gt;=2: print details for all parameters lists (addresses)</li>
    <li>&gt;=3: print interrupt callback information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Changed the connect() and disconnect() methods to return an error if the device
    address specified by the pasynUser is invalid (i.e. &lt;-1 or &gt;MAX_ADDR-1).</p>
  <p>
    Fixed problem that was causing dynamic builds (e.g. SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES) to fail
    on Windows.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver/exceptions</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to allow compiling with the old vxWorks Tornado 2.0.2.1 compiler. Thanks
    to Dirk Zimoch for this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    Other</h3>
  <p>
    Many minor changes to avoid compiler warnings on Linux, vxWorks, and WIN32. Thanks
    to Dirk Zimoch for many of these.</p>

  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug that caused a deadlock if pasynManager-&gt;lockPort was called multiple
    times without calling pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort in between. Thanks to Sebastian
    Marsching from "aquenos GmbH" for this fix.
  </p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for setting the record timestamp from the driver, using a new field,
    pasynUser-&gt;timeStamp. The driver can set this field in read and callback operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fixed a long-standing bug in devAsynXXXArray support for input waveform records
    with SCAN=I/O Intr. The data were being copied to the record without using dbScanLock.
    This meant that the data could change while the record was processing.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the "ring buffer overflow" messages from "ASYN_TRACE_ERROR" to "ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE",
    so they do not appear by default. These messages are not really errors, but warnings
    that record processing it not keeping up with the rate of driver callbacks for records
    with SCAN=I/O Intr.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug when adding a parameter that already existed. Thanks to Hinko Kocevar
    for fixing this.</p>
  <h3>
    Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    Added new document "HowToDoSerial_StreamDevice.html".</p>
  <h3>
    Test programs</h3>
  <p>
    Added new test program, testConnectApp. It uses asynPortDriver, and has a polling
    thread that sends a user-defined string to a device and reads the response. It can
    be used to test the behavior when the device is disconnected and then reconnects,
    etc.</p>
  <h3>
    Build system</h3>
  <p>
    Added a rule in asyn/Makefile to fix a problem that could cause parallel make to
    fail.</p>

    <h2>
      May 21, 2012</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added a new interface, asynEnum. This interface is designed to allow drivers to
    set the strings, values, and severities for record enum fields. This can be done
    both at iocInit(), in init_record() with the pasynEnumSyncIO-&gt;read() function,
    and after iocInit via callbacks to device support.
  </p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the new asynEnum interface for bo, bi, mbbo, and mbbi records
    in the asynInt32 and asynUInt32Digital device support. These records now attempt
    to read the initial values of the strings, values (mbbo and mbbi only) and severities
    for the enum fields. They also support callbacks on the asynEnum interface, so that
    enum values can be set dynamically at run-time.</p>
  <p>
    Improved the support for setting the alarm status of records. Previously for records
    that were not I/O Intr scanned STAT was always to READ_ALARM or WRITE_ALARM, and
    SEVR was set to INVALID_ALARM. A new function, pasynEpicsUtils-&gt;asynStatusToEpicsAlarm()
    was added that converts asynStatus values to EPICS alarm values. This allows records
    to have STAT=TIMEOUT_ALARM, DISABLE_ALARM, etc. More values of STAT can be supported
    in the future by adding more values to the asynStatus enum.</p>
  <p>
    Previously it was not possible for input records with SCAN=I/O Intr to have their
    alarm status set at all. This support has been added. Device support now uses the
    pasynUser-&gt;auxStatus field in the pasynUser passed to the callback function.
    If auxStatus != asynSuccess then the record alarm STAT and SEVR are set to values
    based on the asynStatus. asyn port drivers can now signal error status to clients
    in callback functions by setting pasynUser-&gt;auxStatus to asynSuccess, asynTimeout,
    asynError, etc. This change should be backwards compatible with all drivers because
    the pasynUser that is used for the callbacks is private to the callback function,
    and the auxStatus field is initialized to 0, which is asynSuccess.</p>
  <p>
    Added new waveform record device support, asynInt32TimeSeries and asynFloat64TimeSeries.
    These use callbacks from the driver on those respective interfaces to collect a
    time series of values in a waveform record. Added new medm file asynTimeSeries.adl
    for this, and added an example waveform record to testEpics/Db/devInt32.db.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs that caused crashes if SCAN=I/O Intr was set at iocInit.</p>
  <h3>
    asynDriver and asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for I/O redirection to the "dbior" and "asynPrint" commands.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the new asynEnum interface described above.</p>
  <p>
    Added support in asynPortDriver for passing status information to clients in callbacks.
    Each parameter in the parameter library now has an associated asynStatus variable.
    New functions setParamStatus() and getParamStatus() are provided to access this
    variable. For example, if setParamStatus(paramIndex, asynError) is called then callParamCallbacks()
    will cause any input records with SCAN=I/O Intr to go into alarm state.</p>
  <p>
    Moved asynPortDriver from the miscellaneous directory to its own directory. Improved
    the internals, but did not change the API. Thanks to John Hammonds for this.</p>
  <h3>
    Other</h3>
  <p>
    Added a new test application, testErrorsApp. This application uses a driver based
    on asynPortDriver to test error handling for all interfaces and all records support
    by the asyn standard device support (asyn/devEpics). It can be used to test error
    handling of records with both periodic scanning and I/O Intr scanning. It also tests
    the new asynEnum interface for setting enum strings, values, and severities at iocInit.</p>
  <p>
    Removed the newline terminator from all messages in pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage.
    This formatting does not belong in the error message. Thanks to Lewis Muir for this.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPServerPort. Added call to epicsSocketEnableAddressReuseDuringTimeWaitState
    which fixes problems when the IOC is restarted and the port is still in TIME_WAIT
    state. Thanks to Lewis Muir for this.</p>

    Miscellaneous</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to avoid compiler warnings on 64-bit Darwin.</p>
  <p>
    Changes to avoid compiler warnings and errors on older Solaris compiler.</p>
  <p>
    Changed non-standard __VAR_ARGS__ to __VA_ARGS__ in asynPrint macro.</p>
  <p>
    Added titles to EDM screens.</p>
  <p>
    Added CSS BOY screens.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed build problem. It was rebuilding the VXI11 code with rpcgen each time make
    was run, even if nothing had changed.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Cleaned up logic for callbacks on asynUInt32Digital interface. It was not doing
    callbacks if the value had not changed but an interrupt had occured for bits in
    the mask. This would happen when interrupts were only enabled on the falling or
    rising edges but not both. Added an additional form of setUIntDigitalParam that
    takes an interruptMask argument. In the previous releases drivers were calling setUInt32Interrupt
    for callbacks which is not correct. That function should only be called by device
    support to tell the driver which interrupts to recognize. These problems made the
    quadEM not work correctly with the ipUnidig.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Bug fix on WIN32. It was waiting forever when timeout=0 when it should return whatever
    characters are available without waiting at all.</p>

      August 3, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed asynRecord.dbd to include promptgroup for fields that need it. Removed the
    SOCK field and asynSocketSetup.adl; the record no longer supports creating sockets,
    which can easily be done with the iocsh drvAsynIPPortConfigure command.</p>
  <p>
    Added IXON, IXOFF, and IXANY fields for new XON/XOFF support on serial ports. These
    fields were added to the asynSerialPortSetup.adl medm screen.</p>
  <h3>
    devAsynXXXArray</h3>
  <p>
    For waveform output records the device support was always writing NELM elements,
    rather than NORD elements.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeCom.c</h3>
  <p>
    Added missing include file, which caused asyn not to build on EPICS base versions
    before 3.14.10.</p>
  <h3>
    vxi11core_xdr.c</h3>
  <p>
    Removed unneeded declarations of 'register int32_t *buf' from many functions. Removed
    register keyword from remaining instances, because address was being taken, which
    is illegal in C, and was causing errors on vxWorks Pentium cross-compiler.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added a global function, findAsynPortDriver(const char *portName), that returns
    a pointer to an asynPortDriver object given the asyn port name.</p>
  <p>
    Added 3 new asynPortDriver methods: setUInt32DigitalInterrupt, clearUInt32Interrupt,
    getUInt32Interrupt. These were needed to complete the asynUInt32Digital support.</p>
  <h3>
    asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    The asynOctetSetInputEos, asynOctetSetOutputEos, asynOctetShowInputEos and asynOctetShowOutputEos
    commands now take effect even if the port is not connected. This makes startup scripts
    more robust in the face of devices that are not accessible at IOC startup. Removed
    the unused "drvInfo" parameter from each of these functions.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Host name lookup is now deferred until port connection time. This makes startup
    scripts robust in the face of a device that is offline at IOC startup and has been
    offline for so long that it's DNS entry has been deleted.</p>
  <p>
    Prevent reconnects during IOC shutdown. The IP Port exithandler runs before record
    scanning stops. In that interval, if a record is scanned then it will trigger a
    reconnect, and new connection can be shutdown without sending data, or without waiting
    for a reply. Some embedded TCP/IP stacks have problems dealing with this. Thanks
    to Michael Davidsaver for this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for local serial ports on Windows, i.e.win32-x86 and windows-x64 architectures.
    Previously Windows local serial ports were only supported on the cygwin-x86 architecture.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for serial line software handshake flags (ixon/ixoff/xany) on most
    architectures (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, Darwin, WIN32; see: man stty) and vxWorks (ixon
    only). Thanks to Dirk Zimoch for this.</p>

    Support has been added for terminal servers which support the TELNET RFC 2217`protocol.
    To communicate with such devices specify "COM" as the protocol in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure

  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs in connection management. Releases 4-11 through 4-13 had the following
    problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a port was multi-device and auto-connect, and was only accessed using SyncIO
      calls, then asynManager would never connect to the devices. If regular queued requests
      were used, which happens if an asyn record is connected to that port and device,
      then it would connect once the first queue request was done.</li>
    <li>For all auto-connect ports there was a race condition, such that the port might
      or might not be connected when the first queued request or SyncIO call was done
      on that port. This arose because when the port registered its asynCommon interface,
      asynManager queued a connection request on that port. But if that connection request
      callback, which executes in the portThread, had not yet occurred when a queue request
      or SyncIO call was made, then those operations would be rejected because the port
      was not yet connected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These problems were fixed by doing the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the port registers its asynCommon interface and asynManager queues the connection
      request, it now waits for a short time for the connection callback to complete.
      The default time is 0.5 seconds, but this time can be changed with a call to the
      new function pasynManager-&gt;setAutoConnectTimeout(double timeout). This function
      can be accessed from the iocsh shell with the new asynSetAutoConnectTimeout(double
      timeout) command. This short timeout is designed to allow devices time to connect
      if they are available, but not to excessively slow down booting of the IOC by waiting,
      for example, for the system timeout on TCP connections. Note that this change means
      that it is now very likely that the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() call will occur as
      soon as the asynCommon interface is registered. As noted in the R4-12 release notes,
      this means that the driver must have already done all initialization required for
      the asynCommon-&gt;connect() callback before it registers the asynCommon interface!</li>
    <li>There is an additional new function, pasynManager-&gt;waitConnect(asynUser *pasynUser,
      double timeout), which will wait for the for the port to connect, up to the specified
      timeout. This function can be called from the iocsh with the new command asynWaitConnect(const
      char *portName, double timeout). This function makes it possible to wait longer
      for a port to connect then the current value of the global autoconnect timeout described
      above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fixed problems with the SyncIO calls, which were caused by the implementation of
    pasynManager-&gt;lockPort():</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The SyncIO calls (e.g. asynOctetSyncIO) are implemented by calling pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(),
      executing the I/O in the current thread, and then calling pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort().
      These SyncIO functions are designed to be called from threads that are allowed to
      block, such as SNL programs, or other drivers. The problem with the previous implementation
      was that pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() immediately took the port mutex when it was
      available, rather than queueing a request to take the mutex. This could lead to
      one thread effectively getting exclusive access to the port, even if other threads
      had queued requests or tried to do SyncIO calls themselves. For example, if a device
      could send unsolicited input, then one might create a thread that simply called
      pasynOctetSyncIO-&gt;read() with a short timeout in a tight loop. The problem with
      this was that as soon as that thread released the port mutex when the read timed
      out, it would take the mutex again, blocking other threads that were trying to access
      the port.&nbsp; Previously the only solution to this problem was to add a short
      epicsThreadSleep() in the read loop.</li>
    <li>This problem has been fixed by reimplementing pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(), which
      now queues a request to access the port and then blocks until the queue request
      callback runs in the portThread. When the queue request runs, the thread that called
      pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() executes, and the portThread blocks, until pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort()
      is called.</li>
    <li>Note that this change to lockPort() does change its functionality in one respect:
      previously it was OK to call lockPort() on a port that was not connected. This is
      no longer possible, because the queueRequest call in lockPort will now return an
      error if the port is not connected.</li>
    <li>The change to lockPort did not require any changes to the asynXXXSyncIO functions
      except asynCommonSyncIO. The asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice and asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice
      calls cannot use lockPort() any more, because as noted above it does not work with
      disconnected ports. Rather, these functions now directly queue a connection request
      with a private callback function to connect or disconnect the port.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    vxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in driver initialization. The driver had not completed all required
    initialization before it called pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort. Because pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort
    registers the asynCommon interface, that now normally triggers an immediate callback
    to vxiConnect, and the driver was not yet properly initialized to handle that callback.</p>
  <p>
    Added an additional example driver, asynPortTest, that uses asynPortDriver. It implements
    the asynInt32, asynFloat64, and asynOctet interfaces to communicate with the echo
    server using asynOctetSyncIO calls. This tests nested SyncIO calls. Added a new
    startup script, database and medm screen for testing this new driver.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Added a call to asynOctet-&gt;flush() just before the call to asynOctet-&gt;write()
    operation when doing write/read operations. This eliminates any stale input that
    may have already been sent by the device and would otherwise be incorrectly returned
    by the read operation.</p>
  <h3>

  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Changed ipEchoServer2.c to eliminate the epicsThreadSleep(0.01) in the listener
    thread. This sleep is no longer necessary because of the change to lockPort described
    above, so the example program was changed to test and demonstrate this.</p>

    A return of 0 from a read of a TCP stream is treated as an END condition rather

  <p>
    Support has been added for devices such as web servers that require a connect at
    the beginning of each transaction. To enable this behaviour, specify "http" as the
    protocol in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command and ensure that each transaction
    ends with a read that detects the broken connection from the device. Note that the
    device will always appear connected. The connect/disconnect around each transaction
    is handled within the drvAsynIPPort driver.</p>

  <h3>
    devEPICS</h3>
  <p>
    The ring buffer code in devAsynFloat64.c, devAsynInt32.c and devAsynUInt32Digital.c
    has been improved. Previously when ring buffer overflow occurred during a callback
    the new value was simply discarded. This meant that when the record processed at
    the end of a rapid burst of callbacks it would not contain the most recent value.
    Now when overflow occurs the oldest value is removed from from the ring buffer and
    the new value is added, so that the record will contain the most recent callback
    value after a burst.</p>
  <p>
    asynUInt32Digital: asynMask values implying shifts greater than 16 bits are now

  <h3>

    Added drvInfo strings to parameter lists, and new methods to support this: createParam(),
    findParam(), getParamName(). The report functions now print out the drvInfo strings,
    which is very useful. The base class drvUserCreate() method can now be used without
    reimplementing in derived classes, because the parameter names are now available
    to the base class. Removed asynParamString_T and drvUserCreateParam(), which are
    no longer needed. The testAsynPortDriver test application has been updated to use
    these new features.</p>

  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    A problem was introduced in R4-11 by not starting the autoconnect process until
    iocInit(), and operations that do not use the XXXSyncIO functions thus fail before
    iocInit(). This means, for example, that calls to asynSetOption() to set serial
    port parameters fail if done in a startup script before iocInit(). R4-12 fixes this
    problem by decoupling autoconnect operations from iocInit(). NOTE: The first call
    to the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() function now happens almost immediately after pasynManager-&gt;registerInterface()
    is called for the asynCommon interface. This timing is different from all previous
    asyn releases, and it means that port drivers must initialize everything required
    by asynCommon-&gt;connect() before they register the asynCommon interface. This
    may require minor re-ordering of the initialization sequence in some drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Requests to set end-of-string values or serial port parameters are accepted even
    when the port is not connected. The request takes effect when the port is connected.

    that may be unavailable on startup.</p>

    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    asynReport at detail level 0 now reports only disconnected subaddresses.</p>
  <p>
    The autoconnect code has undergone considerable modification. When a port is registered
    with autoConnect true, or whenever a port disconnect exception is raised on an autoConnect
    port, an attempt at connection occurs immediately followed by retry attempts at
    20 second intervals. Attempts to queue requests to a disconnected port (even an
    autoConnect port) will be rejected. These changes have been made to reduce the occurences
    of 'connection flurries' and to ensure that requests do not languish in the queue
    when connections are broken.</p>
  <p>
    Setting the trace mask or trace I/O mask for a port now also sets the trace mask
    or trace I/O mask for every device associated with that port.</p>
  <p>
    Passing a NULL pasynUser argument to the setTraceMask and setTraceIOMask will set
    the asynBase (default) trace mask or trace I/O mask. To do this from the iocsh pass
    a zero length portName string to the iocsh commands asynSetTraceMask or asynSetTraceIOMask.</p>

  <h3>
    asynOctet</h3>
  <p>
    Ths asynOctet <strong>writeRaw</strong> and <strong>readRaw</strong> methods have
    been removed. In most cases, if your code now calls readRaw or writeRaw it should
    be safe to simply change these calls to their non-Raw equivalent. If you're paranoid
    about someone interposing the end-of-string processing layer you could add something
    like the following to ensure that there is no end-of-string to match:</p>
  <pre>pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);</pre>
  <p>
    If you need to switch to 'raw' mode for a while and then back to 'eos mode', you
    can use code similar to that in devGpib.c:readArbitraryBlockProgramData:</p>
  <pre>char saveEosBuf[5];
int saveEosLen;
.
.
.
status = pasynOctet-&gt;getInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,saveEosBuf,sizeof saveEosBuf,&amp;saveEosLen);
if (status != asynSuccess) {
    epicsSnprintf(pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage,pasynUser-&gt;errorMessageSize,"Device EOS too long!");
    return -1;
}
if (saveEosLen)
pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);

  </p>
  <p>
    When compiling your code against this new version of asyn you should pay particular
    attention to warning messages of the form "warning: initialization from incompatible
    pointer type". These are a good indication that you're initializing an <strong>asynOctet</strong>
    structure with the old-style I/O methods.</p>

  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Undid the change that was done in R4-9 with direct calls to dbScanLock and process
    in the interrupt callback functions. This could lead to deadlocks in some circumstances.
    The original reason for changing from scanIoRequest to (dbScanLock, process) was
    because callback values would be lost if the callbacks came so close together in
    time that the single callback value stored in device support was overwritten before
    scanIoRequest could process the record. This problem has been fixed by adding a
    FIFO (ring buffer) to the device support for the scalar interfaces asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital,
    and asynFloat64. The ring buffer is only created when the record is put into I/O
    Intr scan, so the storage is not allocated for records that are not I/O Intr scanned.
    The ring buffer default size is 10 values, but this can be changed on a per-record
    basis using the dbInfo string "FIFO" with a value such as "100".</p>
  <p>
    Added support for bi and bo records for asynInt32 interface. Previously these records
    were only supported for the asynUInt32Digital interface.</p>

           using the sign bit (e.g. bit abs(nbits)-1 starting at bit 0).
  </pre>
  <h3>
    devEpics/devAsynInt32Array, devAsynFloat64Array</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for callbacks from driver to device support. This allows waveform
    records to have I/O Intr scanning, as already supported for other records in devEpics.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics/asynEpicsUtils</h3>
  <p>
    Changed parser so it requires an exact match to "asyn(" or "asynMask(". Previously
    it tolerated other characters before the "(", and in particular it accepted "asynMask("
    when "asyn(" was expected. Note that this change could cause problems with database
    files if they did not follow the documented syntax, which has no white space between
    "asyn" or "asynMask" and the "(" character.</p>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fix errors in format strings for asynPrint.</p>
  <p>
    Temporary fix to asynReport thread for Cygwin. If the amount of output is small
    the thread exists for a very short time, and this causes a crash. The fix is a short
    wait, but it should really be fixed in base/src/libCom/osi/os/posix/osdThread.c.</p>
  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Fix problem with Makefile.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Add more SCPI commands to devGpib template.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Close sockets on application exit. This is very important for vxWorks, otherwise
    sockets are not closed cleanly which often leads to problems when the IOC reboots.</p>
  <h3>
    drvGsIP488</h3>
  <p>
    Hold off SRQ callbacks until iocInit.</p>

  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Clean up operation on POSIX/termios systems (everything but vxWorks). The old mechanism
    was prone to polling during read operations rather than using the termios read timeout
    mechanism.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    asynRecord sets line-buffering on trace file.</p>
  <p>
    Peter Mueller provided code to remove/restore a device from/to the SRQ polling list.</p>
  <h3>
    drvGsIP488.c</h3>
  <p>
    Clean up dangling 'default' statement.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed error in GPIBACMD operations.</p>
  <h3>
    linuxGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Patches from Gasper Jansa to improve option handling.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed null pointer dereference for all device support when SCAN=I/O Intr and asyn
    port could not be found.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed buffer overflow error when NRRD&gt;40 and IFMT=ASCII.</p>
  <h3>
    asynGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Read method now sets return status and *eomReason properly.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort/drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    *eomReason now set to ASYN_EOM_CNT when read count has been satisfied.</p>
  <p>
    Fix timeout settings on RTEMS.</p>
  <p>
    Add support for UDP broadcasts. Specify "UDP*" and the network broadcast address
    in the port configuration command:<br />
    <code>drvAsynIPPortConfigure("L0", "192.168.1.255:1234 UDP*", 0, 0, 0)</code></p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Full support for new timeout semantics (timeout&lt;0 means "wait forever for characters
    to arrive", timeout=0 means "return characters immediately available", timeout&gt;0
    means "return a timeout status if no characters are received within the specified
    number of seconds").</p>

    <h2>
      Release 4-6</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort/drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed NULL pointer dereference.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Previous versions of drvAsynIPPort.c (1.29 and earlier, asyn R4-5 and earlier) attempted
    to allow 2 things:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use an EPICS timer to time-out an I/O operation, such as send(), recv() and connect().</li>
    <li>Periodically check (every 5 seconds) during a long I/O operation to see if the
      operation should be cancelled.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Item 1) above was not really implemented because there is no portable robust way
    to abort a pending I/O operation. So the timer set a flag which was checked after
    the poll() was complete to see if the timeout had occured. This was not robust,
    because there were competing timers (timeout timer and poll) which could fire in
    the wrong order.</p>
  <p>
    Item 2) was not implemented, because asyn has no mechanism to issue a cancel request
    to a driver which is blocked on an I/O operation.</p>
  <p>
    Since neither of these mechanisms was working as designed, the driver has been re-written
    to simplify it. If one or both of these are to be implemented in the future the
    code as of version 1.29 should be used as the starting point.</p>
  <p>
    If pasynUser-&gt;timeout &lt; 0 an infinite timeout is now used.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug so that ports connected with a file descriptor in pasynUser-&gt;reason
    execute code to set timeouts.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug to return error if pasynCommon-&gt;connect is called when port already
    connected.</p>
  <h3>
    asynTrace</h3>
  <p>
    Added two new functions which are related to pasynTrace-&gt;print and pasynTrace-&gt;printIO
    the way vprintf is related to printf.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprint Same as pasynTrace-&gt;print except that instead of a variable
      of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprintIO Same as pasynTrace-&gt;printIO except that instead of
      a variable of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Changed pasynManager-&gt;connectDevice for ports which have the properties autoConnect=1
    and isConnected=0. In this case a request is queued to call asynCommon-&gt;connect
    for that port. This ensures that ports that have a pasynUser connected to them will
    report being connected even if no I/O has yet been done. Previously such ports reported
    a disconnected state until the first I/O or operation such as setTraceMask. This
    was confusing.</p>
  <p>
    Clarify documentation on meaning of pasynUser-&gt;timeout. Previously there was
    no documented method of specifying an "infinite" timeout to a driver, and the meaning
    of timeout=0.0 was not defined. The new definitions are:</p>
  <p>
    &gt; 0.0 Wait for up to timeout seconds for the I/O to complete</p>
  <p>
    = 0.0 Peform any I/O that can be done without blocking. Return timeout error if
    no I/O can be done without blocking.</p>
  <p>
    &lt; 0.0 Infinite timeout. Wait forever for I/O to complete.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs with asynFloat64Average device support. The wrong interrupt function
    was being called, and UDF was not being cleared.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-5</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    memMalloc/memFree</h3>
  <p>
    memMalloc was allocating the amount of memory the caller requested rather than the
    amount required for the freeList. If memFree was called and the memory reallocated
    to a user requesting a larger size, memory corruption occured. This is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    SyncIO routines</h3>
  <p>
    If the connect call fails the asynUser is no longer freed. Instead a message is
    put into asynUser.errorMessage. The caller must call disconnect in order to free
    the storage for the asynUser.</p>
  <p>
    The SyncIO routines no longer call asynPrint if there is an error and there is a
    valid asynUser available. Rather they return an error message in pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage.
    The SyncIO*Once functions still call asynPrint for errors, because they do not have
    a way of returning an error message.</p>
  <h3>
    Serial, TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Handle 0-length write requests.</p>
  <h3>
    TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Added drvAsynIPServerPort to support TCP and UDP socket servers.</p>
  <p>
    Added iocBoot/testIPServer to test TCP server support.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort now closes TCP sockets when remote system closes connection.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort connect function now uses pasynUser-&gt;reason as a file descriptor
    if it is &gt; 0. This allows drvAsynIPServerPort to re-use asyn ports it creates.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0. It was not setting eomReason at all
    previously.</p>
  <h3>
    Serial</h3>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynSerialPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynSerialPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0. It was not setting eomReason
    at all previously.</p>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added asynCommonSyncIO for synchronous support of the asynCommon interface.</p>
  <h3>
    VME GPIB</h3>
  <p>
    Add delay loops to get these boards to work with faster VME CPU modules.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-4</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    VXI11</h3>
  <p>
    Better support was provided for VXI-11.3 controllers, i.e. talking directly to an
    ethernet port on an instrument. In particular a TDS3054B was tested.</p>
  <p>
    WARNING: The VXI-11.1 ansd VXI-11.3 standards do NOT allow access to GPIB lines,
    i.e. conmmands like Untalk/Unlisten are not possible. The previous support issued
    these commands after each read or write. Some really old GPIB devices may fail.
    If so the device specific code must be modified to sent these commands separately.</p>
  <h3>
    win32</h3>
  <p>
    Changes were made to allow asyn to build on native Windows (win32-x86) architecture.</p>
  <p>
    There are two asyn components that do not yet work on win32-x86.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Local serial ports. The asyn uses the "termios" API for serial ports, and termios
      is not available for native Windows.</li>
    <li>VXI-11. The asyn VXI-11 support uses the Sun XDR API, which is not available for
      native Windows.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Users who want to use local serial ports or VXI-11 on Windows can use the Cygwin
    EPICS build (cygwin-x86).</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib: devGpibConvertExample</h3>
  <p>
    An example of how to implement convert routines for devGpib support modules is available
    in asyn/devGpib/devGpibConvertExample.c</p>
  <h3>
    devAsynOctet.c</h3>
  <p>
    The UDF field is now set FALSE when the VAL field is updated.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-3</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>lock/unlock renamed to blockProcessCallback/unblockProcessCallback
      <p>
        The names have been changed and now these methods only work for asynchronous ports.
        An error is returned if blockProcessCallback is called for a synchronous port.</p>
    </li>
    <li>lockPort/unlockPort
      <p>
        These are new asynManager methods. They can be used in place of queueRequest if
        the caller can block. They have been added to make it easier to implement a driver
        with one addressing scheme that is a asynUser of a driver with a different addressing
        scheme. For example a multi-drop serial driver can be implemented that calls a standard
        serial driver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>asynLockPortNotify
      <p>
        This is a new interface for driver's that call other drivers.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    cancelInterruptUser</h3>
  <p>
    The cancelInterruptUser methods of all interfaces has been changed from</p>
  <pre>    asynStatus (*cancelInterruptUser)(void *registrarPvt, asynUser *pasynUser);</pre>
  <p>
    to</p>
  <pre>    asynStatus (*cancelInterruptUser)(void *drvPvt, asynUser *pasynUser,

    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Several improvements were made to devSupportGpib.c. All changes should be transparent
    to code that uses devGpib.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetBase</h3>
  <p>
    The <span style="font-family: courier">maxchars</span> argument to <span style="font-family: courier">
      callInterruptUsers</span> has been removed.</p>
  <h3>
    asynReport</h3>
  <p>
    The filename argument has been removed.</p>
  <h3>
    devAsynFloat64</h3>
  <p>
    For <span style="font-family: courier">asynAoFloat64</span> it now uses <span style="font-family: courier">
      oval</span> instead of <span style="font-family: courier">val</span>.</p>
  <h3>
    asynFloat64Array, asynInt32Array, asynOctet, asynOctetSyncIO</h3>

    All length and size arguments now have type <span style="font-family: courier">size_t</span>.</p>
  <h3>
    asynFloat64SyncIO, asynInt32SyncIO, asynOctetSyncIO, and asynUInt32DigitalSyncIO</h3>

  <h3>
    devAsynFloat64</h3>
  <p>
    Device support was not returning 2 (do not convert) for ai records when it should.
    This meant that the VAL field was being set back to 0 by the record after device
    support wrote to it. This bug is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    The record sometimes did not read the current input and output EOS values from the

  <h3>
    Acknowledgement</h3>
  <p>
    Yevgeny A. Gusev has again reported some hard to recognize bugs. He must have spent
    many hours looking at the code. His extra set of very good eyes are much appreciated!!.
    He also thought of the way to handle support that uses one addressing scheme but
    wants to use support that has a different addressing scheme. For example support
    for mult-drop serial that wants to use the standard serial support</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-2</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEos</h3>
  <p>
    If read reads maxchars, it forced the last character to be 0 and returned asynOverflow
    if it wasn't. This is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort,drvAsynIPPort - Error reporting</h3>
  <p>
    These did not properly set an error message in asynUser.errorMessage when they returned
    asynError. This is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort - serial port options</h3>
  <p>
    Changes were made to the way serial port options are handled.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>initial values
      <p>
        Previosly defaults were assigned for all options. Now the initial values are fetched
        from either the termios (POSIX) or sioLib (vxWorks).</p>
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>vxWorks clocal and crtscts
      <p>
        The vxWorks sioLib uses clocal for what POSIX calls crtscts. The new serial support
        for vxWorks accepts both clocal and crtscts to specify RTSCTS (Request to send,
        Clear to send).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynRecord - Serial Port Options</h3>

  <h3>
    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <p>
    APOLOGY: Many interfaces have changed since release 3-3. This is the reason this
    release is called 4-0.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>asynManager - Only report has changed. Many new methods have been added. asynManager:report
      takes an additional parameter, portName.</li>
    <li>asynOctet - The read/write methods are similar to before. The new version has
      sepearate end of string methods for input and output.</li>
    <li>register based interfaces - Extensive changes have occured.</li>
    <li>devGpib - Unless special conversion routines call low level drivers, debGpib support
      should work without any changes.</li>
    <li>devEpics -
      <ul>
        <li>Extensive changes have occured. The support naming now follows the names of asyn
          interfaces. For example devAsynInt32 contains device support for interface asynInt32.</li>
        <li>device definitions have changed.
          <p>
            Blanks no longer appear in the menu choices. For example.</p>
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,devAiAsynInt32,"asyn Int32")
       </pre>
          is now
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,asynAiInt32,"asynInt32")
       </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynOctetSyncIO
      <ul>
        <li>All read and write methods now return asynStatus and have additional args to return
          the number of bytes sent/received.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>The IEOS and OEOS fields are set to the current values for the port when the record
          connects to the port. If they are modified after the record connects to the port,
          then the EOS strings will be changed using asynOctet-&gt;setOutputEos or asynOctet-&gt;setIbputEos.
          IMPORTANT: The values of IEOS and OEOS in the database file are never used, because
          they are modified when the record connects to the port.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>interrupt support -A major new feature is support for interrupts. See asynDriver.html
      for details.</li>
    <li>linuxGpib - This is support for the linuxGpib open source project. It contains
      support for many linux gpib kernel drivers. The asyn support was provided by Rok
      Sabjan (cosyLab).</li>
    <li>cancelRequest - If cancelRequest is called while either the process or timeout
      callback is active, it now waits until the callback completes.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>Added PCNCT field to connect/disconnect from port, and to indicate if port is
          currently connected.</li>
        <li>Added DRVINFO and REASON fields to provide control for the drvUser interface.</li>
        <li>Added support for register interfaces (asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital, and asynFloat64).
          New I/O fields for this support are I32INP, I32OUT, UI32INP, UI32OUT, UI32MASK,
          F64INP, and F64OUT. The new IFACE field is used to select the currently active interface.</li>
        <li>Added new fields to indicate if a particular interface is supported by the driver.
          These fields are OCTETIV, I32IV, UI32IV, F64IV, OPTIONIV, and GPIBIV.</li>
        <li>Added support for I/O Intr scanning for any driver/interface that supports callbacks.
          asynOctet does not yet support callbacks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 3-3</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>MAY BE MORE - This release has major new features. Implementing the new features
      may have caused some imcompatibilities, This list is likely to grow as existing
      users report problems.</li>
    <li>queueRequest - If the portDriver does not block then the queue callback is called
      by queueRequest rather than by a separate thread. User code can call canBlock to
      find out how the callback is called.</li>
    <li>registerPort - The argument multiDevice has been replaced by attributes. Attributes
      currently has two bits ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK. The port driver is responsible
      for setting both bits correctly.</li>
    <li>setOption/getOption have been moved from asynCommon to a new interface asynOption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Support for register based drivers.
      <ul>
        <li>Generic register based device support for EPICS records.</li>
        <li>Additional fields have been added to asynUser.</li>
        <li>Added pasynManager-&gt;memMalloc() and pasynManager-&gt;memFree() for allocating
          and freeing memory with a freelist. This is primarily meant to be used with pasynManager-&gt;duplicateAsynUser()
          and the new pasynUser-&gt;userData field.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynDriver.h</h3>
  <p>
    The following changes have been made</p>
  <ul>
    <li>userData - this is a new field in asynUser.</li>
    <li>registerPort - Field multiDevice is replaced by attributes. Currently two attributes
      are defined: ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK.</li>
    <li>duplicateAsynUser - This is a new method that creates a new asynUser and initializes
      it with values from an existing asynUser. freeAsynUser now puts the asynUser of
      a free list rather than calling free.</li>
    <li>memMalloc/memFree - New methods that manage storage. It uses a set of free lists
      of different sizes.</li>
    <li>asynCommon no longer has methods setOption/getOption.</li>
    <li>asynOctet is now defined in a separate header file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Removed the GOPT field. This is no longer necessary because the port options are
    automatically read whenever connecting to a port. "special" requests are now queued
    without changing the state of the record, using the new duplicateAsynUser, memMalloc(),
    and memFree() methods. This means that there is no longer a possibility of a special
    request being rejected because the record is busy. It is no longer possible to cancel
    a special request.</p>
  <h3>
    asynGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>asynGpibPort:srqStatus returns asynStatus</li>
    <li>asynGpibPort:serialPoll returns asynStatus. It now only calls a registered callback
      only if statusByte&amp;0x40 is non zero.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    devSupportGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>setEos is now a method.</li>
    <li>completeProcess is a new method. This was added to support synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Failures for GPIBREADW|GPIBEFASTIW were not handled properly. This could cause
      and assert failure. This is fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortFlush</h3>
  <p>
    Flushes input only.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEOS</h3>
  <p>
    The EOS read method now calls the low-level read method only once and returns as
    many characters as the low-level method supplies. This makes the EOS read semantics
    match those of the low-level serial and IP drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    vxi11SetRpcTimeout - now handles fractions of a second properly</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    A new field has beem added, AQR (Abort Queue Request)</p>
  <p>
    The semantics have been changed as follows: process is responsible for all and only
    for I/O operations. Only I/O operations cause the alarm status and severity to change.
    Special is responsible for all other operations performed by asynRecord.</p>

  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE --</strong> The units of the <code>respond2Writes</code>
      field, if greater than 0, are now seconds rather than milliseconds. This change
      was made so that all time values set in the instrument support initialization routine
      are specified uniformly in units of seconds. Very few instrument support files are
      likely to be affected by this change</li>
    <li>The contents of asynRecDevDrv.dbd have been placed in asyn.dbd and asynRecDevDrv.dbd
      has been removed. This allows applications to get correct dbior reports and access
      to asynRecords by including any low-level driver .dbd file.</li>
    <li>The drvAsynTCPPort driver has been renamed drvAsynIPPort since it now supports
      both UDP and TCP protocols. The protocol is selected by adding a "UDP" or "TCP"
      after the "hostname:port" in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command. A missing protocol
      is taken to be "TCP".</li>
    <li>Work around 'missing SPD' bug in HP E2050 GPIB/LAN adapter. SRQ handling is much
      more robust on all supported hardware.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>National Instruments NI1014 VME GPIB interface is now supported.</li>
    <li>GPIB - All low level GPIB support (vxi11, gsip488, and ni1014) now fully support
      the GPIB specific features defined by asynGpibDriver.h</li>
    <li>Implementation of asynTrace is more consistent across the low level drivers.</li>
    <li>Added makeSupport script and template instrument support. Updated tutorials to
      reflect these additions.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 3-1</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The drvGenericSerial driver has been split into drvAsynSerialPort and drvAsynTCPPort
      drivers for local and remote serial ports, respectively. End-of-string processing
      has been moved to an interposed interface.</li>
    <li>The diagnostic facilities previously provided by asynTrace.db have been replaced
      with the much more general asynRecord.db</li>
    <li>All asynManager,asynCommon, and asynOctet methods except report now return asynStatus.
      Methods that previously returned a different value now have an additional argument
      for this value.</li>
    <li>Low-level driver read and write methods now return asynStatus and are passed an
      additional argument through which they store the actual number of characters read
      or written.</li>
    <li>The createSocket method in the asynSyncIO interface has been replaced by openSocket.
      openSocket does not call asynSyncIO-&gt;connect(), that must now be done by the
      caller.</li>
    <li>Removed code for "flush" from gpib drivers. The implementation caused infinite
      loops on devices that speak when not spoken to.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>asynOctetRecord has been renamed to asynRecord</li>
        <li>TIOM, TMSK, TSIZ, TFIL, AUCT, ENBL, CNCT, ERRS, TINP, NAWT fields have been added</li>
        <li>Default values of OMAX and IMAX decreased from 512 to 80</li>
        <li>Options that are unknown for a device (e.g. baud on a Moxa terminal server) are
          shown as Unknown.</li>
        <li>Many bug fixes and improvements in logic and functionality</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 2-1</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Connection Management - A framework for connection management is provided. It
      provides the ability to connect/disconnect to/from a port or port,addr. It also
      provides enable/disable and autoConnect/noAutoConnect. See the asynDriver for details.</li>
    <li>devAsyn - Generic device support for connect management for a specific device.</li>
    <li>devAsynGeneric - Generic support for connection management and traceing. This
      support dynamically attaches to a port,addr. Thus one set of records and one medm
      display can be used for all devices connected to an ioc.</li>
    <li>asynOctetRecord - A generic record and medm display that allows interactive access
      to many asynDriver features.</li>
    <li>asynSyncIO - A synchronous interface to asynDriver. This can be used by code,
      e.g. SNC programs, that are willing to wait instead of following an asynchronous
      model.</li>

  <h3>
    Support Provided in addition to asynDriver and asynGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
    <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
    <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Future Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Other device support methods especially streams, devSerial, and mpfSerial.</li>
    <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Testing</h3>
  <p>
    The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris, Linux (redhat
    9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been tested with the following
    vxi11 controllers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
      <p>
        It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
    </li>
    <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
    <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
      <p>
        When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2 rather than a
        VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address. SRQs did not work when
        connecting via the ethernet port but did when communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME carrier.</li>
    <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
    <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
    <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa NPort Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support: DG535
    and TDS3014B Scope.</p>

<h1>asynDriver: Asynchronous Driver Support - Release Notes</h1>

<h1>April 14, 2006</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-5</h2>
</center>

<h3>memMalloc/memFree</h3>
<p>memMalloc was allocating the amount of memory the caller requested rather
than the amount required for the freeList.
If memFree was called and the memory reallocated to a user requesting
a larger size, memory corruption occured. This is fixed.
</p>
<h3>SyncIO routines</h3>
<p>If the connect call fails the asynUser is no longer freed.
Instead a message is put into asynUser.errorMessage.
The caller must call disconnect in order to free the storage for the asynUser.
</p>
<p>The SyncIO routines no longer call asynPrint if there is an error and there is
a valid asynUser available.  Rather they return an error message in pasynUser->errorMessage.
The SyncIO*Once functions still call asynPrint for errors, because they do not have a
way of returning an error message.
</p>

<h3>Serial, TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
<p>Handle 0-length write requests.

<h3>TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
<p>Added drvAsynIPServerPort to support TCP and UDP socket servers.
<p>Added iocBoot/testIPServer to test TCP server support.
<p>drvAsynIPPort now closes TCP sockets when remote system closes connection.
<p>drvAsynIPPort connect function now uses pasynUser->reason as a file descriptor if it is > 0.
This allows drvAsynIPServerPort to re-use asyn ports it creates.
<p>Made drvAsynIPPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.
<p>Made drvAsynIPPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0.  It was not setting eomReason at all previously.

<h3>Serial</h3>
<p>Made drvAsynSerialPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.
<p>Made drvAsynSerialPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0.  It was not setting eomReason at all previously.

<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<p>Added asynCommonSyncIO for synchronous support of the asynCommon interface.

<h3>VME GPIB</h3>
<p>Add delay loops to get these boards to work with faster VME CPU modules.

<center>
<h2>Release 4-4</h2>
</center>

<h3>VXI11</h3>
<p>Better support was provided for VXI-11.3 controllers, i.e. talking
directly to an ethernet port on an instrument. In particular
a TDS3054B was tested.</p>
<p>WARNING: The VXI-11.1 ansd VXI-11.3 standards do NOT allow access to
GPIB lines, i.e. conmmands like Untalk/Unlisten are not possible.
The previous support issued these commands after each read or write.
Some really old GPIB devices may fail. If so the device specific code must be
modified to sent these commands separately.</p>

<h3>win32</h3>

<p>Changes were made to allow asyn to build on native Windows (win32-x86)
architecture.</p>

<p>There are two asyn components that do not yet work on win32-x86.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Local serial ports.  The asyn uses the "termios" API for serial ports,
    and termios is not available for native Windows.</li>
  <li>VXI-11.  The asyn VXI-11 support uses the Sun XDR API, which is not
    available for native Windows.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users who want to use local serial ports or VXI-11 on Windows can use the
Cygwin EPICS build (cygwin-x86).</p>

<h3>devGpib: devGpibConvertExample</h3>

<p>An example of how to implement convert routines for devGpib support
modules is available in asyn/devGpib/devGpibConvertExample.c</p>

<h3>devAsynOctet.c</h3>

<p>The UDF field is now set FALSE when the VAL field is updated.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-3</h2>
</center>

<h3>asynManager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>lock/unlock renamed to blockProcessCallback/unblockProcessCallback
    <p>The names have been changed and now these methods only work for
    asynchronous ports. An error is returned if blockProcessCallback is
    called for a synchronous port.</p>
  </li>
  <li>lockPort/unlockPort
    <p>These are new asynManager methods. They can be used in place of
    queueRequest if  the caller can block. They have been added to make it
    easier to implement a driver with one addressing scheme that is a
    asynUser of a driver with a different addressing scheme. For example a
    multi-drop serial driver can be implemented that calls a standard serial
    driver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>asynLockPortNotify
    <p>This is a new interface for driver's that call other drivers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>cancelInterruptUser</h3>

<p>The cancelInterruptUser methods of all interfaces has been changed from</p>
<pre>    asynStatus (*cancelInterruptUser)(void *registrarPvt, asynUser *pasynUser);</pre>
to
<pre>    asynStatus (*cancelInterruptUser)(void *drvPvt, asynUser *pasynUser,
                                      void *registrarPvt);</pre>

<h3>asynTrace</h3>

<p>The length and size arguments now have type <span
style="font-family: courier">size_t</span>.</p>

<h3>devGpib</h3>

<p>Several improvements were made to devSupportGpib.c. All changes should be
transparent to code that uses devGpib.</p>

<h3>asynOctetBase</h3>

<p>The <span style="font-family: courier">maxchars</span> argument to <span
style="font-family: courier">callInterruptUsers</span> has been removed.</p>

<h3>asynReport</h3>

<p>The filename argument has been removed.</p>

<h3>devAsynFloat64</h3>

<p>For <span style="font-family: courier">asynAoFloat64</span> it now uses
<span style="font-family: courier">oval</span> instead of <span
style="font-family: courier">val</span>.</p>

<h3>asynFloat64Array, asynInt32Array, asynOctet, asynOctetSyncIO</h3>

<p>All length and size arguments now have type <span
style="font-family: courier">size_t</span>.</p>

<h3>asynFloat64SyncIO, asynInt32SyncIO, asynOctetSyncIO, and
asynUInt32DigitalSyncIO</h3>

<p>These all use <span
style="font-family: courier">lockPort/unlockPort</span> instead of <span
style="font-family: courier">queueRequest</span>.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-2-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>devAsynFloat64</h3>

<p>Device support was not returning 2 (do not convert) for ai records when it
should.  This meant that the VAL field was being set back to 0 by the record
after device support wrote to it. This bug is fixed.</p>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>The record sometimes did not read the current input and output EOS values
from the driver when it connected. This bug is fixed.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>Yevgeny A. Gusev has again reported some hard to recognize bugs. He must
have spent many hours looking at the code. His extra set of very good eyes
are much appreciated!!. He also thought of the way to handle support that
uses one addressing scheme but wants to use support that has a different
addressing scheme. For example support for mult-drop serial that wants to use
the standard serial support</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>asynInterposeEos</h3>

<p>If read reads maxchars, it forced the last character to be 0 and returned
asynOverflow if it wasn't. This is fixed.</p>

<h3>drvAsynSerialPort,drvAsynIPPort - Error reporting</h3>

<p>These did not properly set an error message in asynUser.errorMessage when
they returned asynError. This is fixed.</p>

<h3>drvAsynSerialPort - serial port options</h3>

<p>Changes were made to the way serial port options are handled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>initial values
    <p>Previosly defaults were assigned for all options. Now the initial
    values are fetched from either the termios (POSIX) or sioLib
    (vxWorks).</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>vxWorks clocal and crtscts
    <p>The vxWorks sioLib uses clocal for what POSIX calls crtscts. The new
    serial support for vxWorks accepts both clocal and crtscts to specify
    RTSCTS (Request to send, Clear to send).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>asynRecord - Serial Port Options</h3>

<p>This has a new option to set Modem Control.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-1</h2>
</center>

<p>The only code change was to fix the drvAsynIPPort and drvAsynSerialPort
segmentation faults on cygwin-x86.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-0</h2>
</center>

<h3>Incompatible Changes.</h3>

<p>APOLOGY: Many interfaces have changed since release 3-3. This is the
reason this release is called 4-0.</p>
<ul>
  <li>asynManager - Only report has changed. Many new methods have been
    added. asynManager:report takes an additional parameter, portName.</li>
  <li>asynOctet - The read/write methods are similar to before. The new
    version has sepearate end of string methods for input and output.</li>
  <li>register based interfaces - Extensive changes have occured.</li>
  <li>devGpib - Unless special conversion routines call low level drivers,
    debGpib support should work without any changes.</li>
  <li>devEpics -
    <ul>
      <li>Extensive changes have occured. The support naming now follows the
        names of asyn interfaces. For example devAsynInt32 contains device
        support for interface asynInt32.</li>
      <li>device definitions have changed.
        <p>Blanks no longer appear in the menu choices. For example.</p>
        <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,devAiAsynInt32,"asyn Int32")
       </pre>
        is now
        <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,asynAiInt32,"asynInt32")
       </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>asynOctetSyncIO
    <ul>
      <li>All read and write methods now return asynStatus and have
        additional args to return the number of bytes sent/received.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>asynRecord
    <ul>
      <li>The IEOS and OEOS fields are set to the current values for the port
        when the record connects to the port.  If they are modified after the
        record connects to the port, then the EOS strings will be changed
        using asynOctet-&gt;setOutputEos or asynOctet-&gt;setIbputEos.
        IMPORTANT: The values of IEOS and OEOS in the database file are never
        used, because they are modified when the record connects to the
      port.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>interrupt support -A major new feature is support for interrupts. See
    asynDriver.html for details.</li>
  <li>linuxGpib - This is support for the linuxGpib open source project. It
    contains support for many linux gpib kernel drivers. The asyn support was
    provided by Rok Sabjan (cosyLab).</li>
  <li>cancelRequest - If cancelRequest is called while either the process or
    timeout callback is active, it now waits until the callback
  completes.</li>
  <li>asynRecord
    <ul>
      <li>Added PCNCT field to connect/disconnect from port, and to indicate
        if port is currently connected.</li>
      <li>Added DRVINFO and REASON fields to provide control for the drvUser
        interface.</li>
      <li>Added support for register interfaces (asynInt32,
        asynUInt32Digital, and asynFloat64).  New I/O fields for this support
        are I32INP, I32OUT, UI32INP, UI32OUT, UI32MASK, F64INP, and F64OUT.
        The new IFACE field is used to select the currently active
      interface.</li>
      <li>Added new fields to indicate if a particular interface is supported
        by the driver.  These fields are OCTETIV, I32IV, UI32IV, F64IV,
        OPTIONIV, and GPIBIV.</li>
      <li>Added support for I/O Intr scanning for any driver/interface that
        supports callbacks. asynOctet does not yet support callbacks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-3</h2>
</center>

<h3>Incompatible Changes.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MAY BE MORE - This release has major new features. Implementing the new
    features may have caused some imcompatibilities, This list is likely to
    grow as existing users report problems.</li>
  <li>queueRequest - If the portDriver does not block then the queue callback
    is called by queueRequest rather than by a separate thread. User code can
    call canBlock to find out how the callback is called.</li>
  <li>registerPort - The argument multiDevice has been replaced by
    attributes. Attributes currently has two bits ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and
    ASYN_CANBLOCK. The port driver is responsible for setting both bits
    correctly.</li>
  <li>setOption/getOption have been moved from asynCommon to a new interface
    asynOption.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Support for synchronous drivers.</li>
  <li>Support for register based drivers.
    <ul>
      <li>Generic register based device support for EPICS records.</li>
      <li>Additional fields have been added to asynUser.</li>
      <li>Added pasynManager-&gt;memMalloc() and pasynManager-&gt;memFree()
        for allocating and freeing memory with a freelist.  This is primarily
        meant to be used with pasynManager-&gt;duplicateAsynUser() and the
        new pasynUser-&gt;userData field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>asynDriver.h</h3>

<p>The following changes have been made</p>
<ul>
  <li>userData - this is a new field in asynUser.</li>
  <li>registerPort - Field multiDevice is replaced by attributes. Currently
    two attributes are defined: ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK.</li>
  <li>duplicateAsynUser - This is a new method that creates a new asynUser
    and initializes it with values from an existing asynUser. freeAsynUser
    now puts the asynUser of a free list rather than calling free.</li>
  <li>memMalloc/memFree - New methods that manage storage. It uses a set of
    free lists of different sizes.</li>
  <li>asynCommon no longer  has methods setOption/getOption.</li>
  <li>asynOctet is now defined in a separate header file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>Removed the GOPT field.  This is no longer necessary because the port
options are automatically read whenever connecting to a port.  "special"
requests are now queued without changing the state of the record, using the
new duplicateAsynUser, memMalloc(), and memFree() methods.  This means that
there is no longer a possibility of a special request being rejected because
the record is busy. It is no longer possible to cancel a special request.</p>

<h3>asynGpib</h3>
<ul>
  <li>asynGpibPort:srqStatus returns asynStatus</li>
  <li>asynGpibPort:serialPoll returns asynStatus. It now only calls a
    registered callback only if statusByte&amp;0x40 is non zero.</li>
</ul>

<h3>devSupportGpib</h3>
<ul>
  <li>setEos is now a method.</li>
  <li>completeProcess is a new method. This was added to support synchronous
    drivers.</li>
  <li>Failures for GPIBREADW|GPIBEFASTIW were not handled properly. This
    could cause and assert failure. This is fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>drvAsynSerialPortFlush</h3>

<p>Flushes input only.</p>

<h3>asynInterposeEOS</h3>

<p>The EOS read method now calls the low-level read method only once and
returns as many characters as the low-level method supplies.  This makes the
EOS read semantics match those of the low-level serial and IP drivers.</p>

<h3>drvVxi11</h3>

<p>vxi11SetRpcTimeout - now handles fractions of a second properly</p>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>A new field has beem added, AQR (Abort Queue Request)</p>

<p>The semantics have been changed as follows: process is responsible for all
and only for I/O operations. Only I/O operations cause the alarm status and
severity to change. Special is responsible for all other operations performed
by asynRecord.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Changed and obsolete features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE --</strong>  The units of the
    <code>respond2Writes</code> field, if greater than 0, are now seconds
    rather than milliseconds. This change was made so that all time values
    set in the instrument support initialization routine are specified
    uniformly in units of seconds. Very few instrument support files are
    likely to be affected by this change</li>
  <li>The contents of asynRecDevDrv.dbd have been placed in asyn.dbd and
    asynRecDevDrv.dbd has been removed.  This allows applications to get
    correct dbior reports and access to asynRecords by including any
    low-level driver .dbd file.</li>
  <li>The drvAsynTCPPort driver has been renamed drvAsynIPPort since it now
    supports both UDP and TCP protocols. The protocol is selected by adding a
    "UDP" or "TCP" after the "hostname:port" in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure
    command. A missing protocol is taken to be "TCP".</li>
  <li>Work around 'missing SPD' bug in HP E2050 GPIB/LAN adapter.  SRQ
    handling is much more robust on all supported hardware.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>National Instruments NI1014 VME GPIB interface is now supported.</li>
  <li>GPIB - All low level GPIB support (vxi11, gsip488, and ni1014) now
    fully support the GPIB specific features defined by asynGpibDriver.h</li>
  <li>Implementation of asynTrace is more consistent across the low level
    drivers.</li>
  <li>Added makeSupport script and template instrument support.  Updated
    tutorials to reflect these additions.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changed and obsolete features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The drvGenericSerial driver has been split into drvAsynSerialPort and
    drvAsynTCPPort drivers for local and remote serial ports, respectively.
    End-of-string processing has been moved to an interposed interface.</li>
  <li>The diagnostic facilities previously provided by asynTrace.db have been
    replaced with the much more general asynRecord.db</li>
  <li>All asynManager,asynCommon, and asynOctet methods except report now
    return asynStatus. Methods that previously returned a different value now
    have an additional argument for this value.</li>
  <li>Low-level driver read and write methods now return asynStatus and are
    passed an additional  argument through which they store the actual number
    of characters read or written.</li>
  <li>The createSocket method in the asynSyncIO interface has been replaced
    by openSocket.&nbsp; openSocket does not call asynSyncIO-&gt;connect(),
    that must now be done by the caller.</li>
  <li>Removed code for "flush" from gpib drivers.&nbsp; The implementation
    caused infinite loops on devices that speak when not spoken to.</li>
  <li>asynRecord
    <ul>
      <li>asynOctetRecord has been renamed to asynRecord</li>
      <li>TIOM, TMSK, TSIZ, TFIL, AUCT, ENBL, CNCT, ERRS, TINP, NAWT fields
        have been added</li>
      <li>Default values of OMAX and IMAX decreased from 512 to 80</li>
      <li>Options that are unknown for a device (e.g. baud on a Moxa terminal
        server) are shown as Unknown.</li>
      <li>Many bug fixes and improvements in logic and functionality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 2-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Connection Management - A framework for connection management is
    provided. It provides the ability to connect/disconnect to/from a port or
    port,addr. It also provides enable/disable and autoConnect/noAutoConnect.
    See the asynDriver for details.</li>
  <li>devAsyn - Generic device support for connect management for a specific
    device.</li>
  <li>devAsynGeneric - Generic support for connection management and
    traceing. This support dynamically attaches to a port,addr. Thus one set
    of records and one medm display can be used for all devices connected to
    an ioc.</li>
  <li>asynOctetRecord - A generic record and medm display that allows
    interactive access to many asynDriver features.</li>
  <li>asynSyncIO - A synchronous interface to asynDriver. This can be used by
    code, e.g. SNC programs, that are willing to wait instead of following an
    asynchronous model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed and obsolete features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>devAsynTrace is replaced by devAsyn and devAsynGeneric.</li>
  <li>asynManager.h
    <ul>
      <li>disconnectDevice has been renamed to disconnect.</li>
      <li>The interface to low level drivers has been drastically modified in
        order to support the new connection management features. See the
        asynDriver documentation for details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>asynGpib
    <ul>
      <li>registerPort has additional arguments multiDevice and
      autoConnect.</li>
      <li>setPortOption,getPortOption are setOption,getOption</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 1-2</h2>
</center>
<ul>
  <li>Promote VXI-11 RPC definition files to vxi11 directory.  Use rpcgen to
    build RPC support files for targets for which this is possible.</li>
  <li>Run rpcgen on Solaris with 'multi-thread' flag.</li>
  <li>Use separate GPIB message/response buffer for each port instance.</li>
  <li>Use sscanf to convert GPIB stringin response.</li>
  <li>Fix race condition in GPIB finish routines.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 1-1</h2>
</center>

<p>This release includes support for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>asynTrace - A trace facility is now implemented.</li>
  <li>gsIP488 - The Greensprings Industry Pack IP488 is now supported</li>
</ul>

<p>Modifications include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Added asynSetPortOption and asynGetPortOption to manipulate port
    options.</li>
  <li>Changed serial support to use asynSetPortOption/asynGetPortOption.</li>

<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 1-0alpha2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Support Provided in addition to asynDriver and asynGpib</h3>
<ul>
  <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
  <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
  <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to
    Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Other device support methods especially streams, devSerial, and
    mpfSerial.</li>
  <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris,
Linux (redhat 9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been
tested with the following vxi11 controllers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
    <p>It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
  </li>
  <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
  <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
    <p>When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2
    rather than a VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address.
    SRQs did not work when connecting via the ethernet port but did when
    communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME
    carrier.</li>
  <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port
  (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
  <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
  <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa
    NPort Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>
Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support:
DG535 and TDS3014B Scope.</body>

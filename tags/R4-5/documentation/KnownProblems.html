<h1>asynDriver: Asynchronous Driver Support - Known Problems</h1>

<h1>April 14 2006</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-5</h2>
</center>

No known problems.

<center>
<h2>Release 4-3</h2>
</center>

<h3>gsIP488</h3>

<p>This fails for fast processors like the 2700 and 5100</p>

<h3>devAsynOctet</h3>

<p>UDF is not set false when the VAL field is modified.</p>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>devAsynFloat64</h3>

<p>Device support is not returning 2 (do not convert) for ai records when it
should.  This means that the VAL field is being set back to 0 by the record
after device support writes to it.</p>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>The record sometimes does not read the current input and output EOS values
from the driver when it connects.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>asynInterposeEos</h3>

<p>If read reads maxchars, it forces the last character to be 0 and returns
asynOverflow if it wasn't.</p>

<h3>drvAsynSerialPort,drvAsynIPPort - Error reporting</h3>

<p>These do not properly set an error message in asynUser.errorMessage when
they return asynError.</p>

<h3>asynRecordFCTL</h3>

<p>This calls setOption for clocal. This only works on vxWorks because
vxWorks uses the name CLOCAL for what POSIX calls CRTSCTS.</p>

<h3>devEpics</h3>

<p>If a call to a low level driver, which registered itself as canBlock,
completes without blocking then the asynchronous completion may never occur.
This will be fixed in the next release.</p>

<h3>drvAsynIPPort and drvAsynSerialPort</h3>

<p>The problem reported for version 4 about segmentation faults on cygwin-x86
has been fixed.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-0</h2>
</center>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>asynRecord (and other code) use epicsStrSnPrintEscaped.  In EPICS 3.14.6
the files epicsVsnprintf on vxWorks (which gets called by several other
epicsXXXprintf routines) and epicsStrSnPrintEscaped each have a bug could
cause buffer overflow. These bugs are guaranteed to lead to corruption in
asynRecord if the received string is longer than 40 characters.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>drvAsynSerial</h3>
<ul>
  <li>drvAsynSerialPort.c has a bug that can cause segmentation faults on
    some systems (e.g. cygwin-x86).  The line
    <pre>static const struct asynOctet drvAsynSerialPortAsynOctet = {</pre>
    must be changed to
    <pre>static struct asynOctet drvAsynSerialPortAsynOctet = {</pre>
    i.e. remove the const keyword.</li>
  <li>drvAsynIPPort.c has a bug that can cause segmentation faults on some
    systems (e.g. cygwin-x86).  The line
    <pre>static const struct asynOctet drvAsynIPPortAsynOctet = {</pre>
    must be changed to
    <pre>static struct asynOctet drvAsynIPPortAsynOctet = {</pre>
    i.e. remove the const keyword.</li>
</ul>

<h3>asynManager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>removeInterruptUser - has not been tested</li>
  <li>addInterruptUser/removeInterruptUser are not allowed to be called from
    interrupt callbacks. This restriction should be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>vxi11</h3>
<ul>
  <li>E5810 reboot -
    <p>John Sinclair (ONRL) reported that the IOC crashed if an E5810 was
    power cycled. This could not be reproduced at APS. We will have to see if
    it is still a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>E5810 serial port -
    <p>Attempts to provide support for the serial port of a E5810 have not
    been successful</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-3</h2>
</center>

<h3>vxi11Configure</h3>

<p>If vxiName is specified as <span
style="font-family: courier">"inst"</span> then the driver incorrectly says
that it does not block.</p>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>If asynRecord is attached to a port that does not implement asynOctet,
then asynRecord crashes of it attempt to send/receive a message.</p>

<h3>asynManager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a queueRequest timeout hangs if the timeout is canceled while the
    timout callback is active.</li>
  <li>cancelRequest also has possible race conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The next release gaurantees that when queueRequest is called:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exactly one of the following occurs:
    <ul>
      <li>queue callback is called</li>
      <li>timeout callback is called</li>
      <li>cancelRequest removes the request before either queue callback or
        timeout callback is called.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If either the queue or timeout callback is active when cancelRequest is
    called, it will not return until the callback completes.</li>
</ol>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Mac OS X (Darwin)</h3>

<p>The RPC library on Mac OS X 10.3.3 does not handle device timeouts
properly and may cause core dumps.  A bug report has been filed with Apple. A
workaround is to use the GNU glibc RPC/XDR routines.</p>

<h3>vxWorks</h3>

<p>Attempting to change the trace file to "stdout" does not work becuase
vxWorks has per-task standard output streams.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>EPICS Base R3.14.6</h3>

<p>When building with EPICS Base R3.14.6 or greater, comment out the
epicsInterruptibleSyscall.h and epicsInterruptibleSyscall.c lines in
asyn/Makefile:</p>
<pre>@@ -19,10 +19,10 @@

<h3>Mac OS X (Darwin)</h3>

<p>The RPC library on Mac OSD 10.3.3 does not handle device timeouts properly
and may cause core dumps.  A bug report has been filed with Apple.  A
workaround is to use the GNU glibc RPC/XDR routines.</p>

<h3>Interrupt Callback</h3>

<p>If a user callback calls a low level driver with an infinite or very long
timeout, there is no way to make the call terminate. Is there a generic way
to abort the call?</p>

<h3>Greensprings IP488</h3>

<p>Does not support GPIB specific functions.</p>

<h3>NI1014 VME Gpib driver</h3>

<p>This needs to be implemented for asynDriver.</p>

<h3>Generic EPICS device support</h3>

<p>Think about  creating generic support for connecting to EPICS records.</p>

<h3>Network Protocols</h3>

<p>Consider generic support for various network protocals: Modbus, etherIP,
etc.</p>

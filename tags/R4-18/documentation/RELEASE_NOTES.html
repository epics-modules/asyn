    <h2>
      Release 4-18</h2>
    <h2>
      November 2, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Miscellaneous</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to avoid compiler warnings on 64-bit Darwin.</p>
  <p>
    Changes to avoid compiler warnings and errors on older Solaris compiler.</p>
  <p>
    Changed non-standard __VAR_ARGS__ to __VA_ARGS__ in asynPrint macro.</p>
  <p>
    Added titles to EDM screens.</p>
  <p>
    Added CSS BOY screens.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed build problem. It was rebuilding the VXI11 code with rpcgen each time make
    was run, even if nothing had changed.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Cleaned up logic for callbacks on asynUInt32Digital interface. It was not doing
    callbacks if the value had not changed but an interrupt had occured for bits in
    the mask. This would happen when interrupts were only enabled on the falling or
    rising edges but not both. Added an additional form of setUIntDigitalParam that
    takes an interruptMask argument. In the previous releases drivers were calling setUInt32Interrupt
    for callbacks which is not correct. That function should only be called by device
    support to tell the driver which interrupts to recognize. These problems made the
    quadEM not work correctly with the ipUnidig.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Bug fix on WIN32. It was waiting forever when timeout=0 when it should return whatever
    characters are available without waiting at all.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-17</h2>
    <h2>
      August 3, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed asynRecord.dbd to include promptgroup for fields that need it. Removed the
    SOCK field and asynSocketSetup.adl; the record no longer supports creating sockets,
    which can easily be done with the iocsh drvAsynIPPortConfigure command.</p>
  <p>
    Added IXON, IXOFF, and IXANY fields for new XON/XOFF support on serial ports. These
    fields were added to the asynSerialPortSetup.adl medm screen.</p>
  <h3>
    devAsynXXXArray</h3>
  <p>
    For waveform output records the device support was always writing NELM elements,
    rather than NORD elements.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeCom.c</h3>
  <p>
    Added missing include file, which caused asyn not to build on EPICS base versions
    before 3.14.10.</p>
  <h3>
    vxi11core_xdr.c</h3>
  <p>
    Removed unneeded declarations of 'register int32_t *buf' from many functions. Removed
    register keyword from remaining instances, because address was being taken, which
    is illegal in C, and was causing errors on vxWorks Pentium cross-compiler.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added a global function, findAsynPortDriver(const char *portName), that returns
    a pointer to an asynPortDriver object given the asyn port name.</p>
  <p>
    Added 3 new asynPortDriver methods: setUInt32DigitalInterrupt, clearUInt32Interrupt,
    getUInt32Interrupt. These were needed to complete the asynUInt32Digital support.</p>
  <h3>
    asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    The asynOctetSetInputEos, asynOctetSetOutputEos, asynOctetShowInputEos and asynOctetShowOutputEos
    commands now take effect even if the port is not connected. This makes startup scripts
    more robust in the face of devices that are not accessible at IOC startup. Removed
    the unused "drvInfo" parameter from each of these functions.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Host name lookup is now deferred until port connection time. This makes startup
    scripts robust in the face of a device that is offline at IOC startup and has been
    offline for so long that it's DNS entry has been deleted.</p>
  <p>
    Prevent reconnects during IOC shutdown. The IP Port exithandler runs before record
    scanning stops. In that interval, if a record is scanned then it will trigger a
    reconnect, and new connection can be shutdown without sending data, or without waiting
    for a reply. Some embedded TCP/IP stacks have problems dealing with this. Thanks
    to Michael Davidsaver for this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for local serial ports on Windows, i.e.win32-x86 and windows-x64 architectures.
    Previously Windows local serial ports were only supported on the cygwin-x86 architecture.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for serial line software handshake flags (ixon/ixoff/xany) on most
    architectures (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, Darwin, WIN32; see: man stty) and vxWorks (ixon
    only). Thanks to Dirk Zimoch for this.</p>
  <h3>
    Miscelleaneous</h3>
  <p>
    Changed asyn/Makefile to fix build dependencies for rpcgen of vxi11. Thanks to Michael
    Davidsaver for this fix.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-16</h2>
    <h2>
      January 17, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Support has been added for terminal servers which support the TELNET RFC 2217`protocol.
    To communicate with such devices specify "COM" as the protocol in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure
    command. This allows port parameters (speed, parity, etc.) to be set using an asynRecord
    or asynSetOption commands just as for local serial ports.</p>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fix from Benjamin Franksen to fix problem with reconnection.</p>
  <p>
    The 'timeout' argument to vxi11Configure has been changed from double to string.
    This allows vxi11Configure to be called directly from the vxWorks shell.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-15</h2>
    <h2>
      December 8, 2010</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    vxi11</h3>
  <p>
    The third argument to the vxi11Configure command is now a bit-map. The least significant
    bit (value 0x1) remains the 'recover with IFC' control. The next-to-least significant
    bit (value 0x2) when set will cause all devices to be locked when a connection is
    made. This allows for cooperative exclusive access to devices.</p>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed memory leak in lockPort() when an error occured, was not calling freeAsynUser().
    Thanks to Andrew Starritt for finding this.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Bug fix for devAsynInt32 and devAsynFloat64: it was not freeing the mutex in processAiAverage
    if numAverage==0, i.e. there had been no callbacks from the driver since the record
    last processed. This would hang the next thread that tried to take the mutex, typically
    the driver callback thread.</p>
  <p>
    Bug fix for devAsynXXXArray: it was calling drvUserCreate in the port driver even
    if there was no userParam in the link, which could crash the driver.</p>
  <h3>
    Many files</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to allow building dynamically on WIN32 (i.e. making DLLs).</p>
  <h3>
    Makefiles</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to allow building on Cygwin 1.7.x or 1.5.x; replaced rpc with $(CYGWIN_RPC_LIB),
    which allows it to link with rpc on 1.5.x and tirpc on 1.7.x. You need to add one
    of the following 2 lines to <code>base/configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.cygwin-x86.cygwin-x86</code></p>
  <pre>    For Cygwin 1.7.x:
    CYGWIN_RPC_LIB = tirpc

    For Cygwin 1.5.x
    CYGWIN_RPC_LIB = rpc

      Release 4-14</h2>
    <h2>
      July 29, 2010</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs in connection management. Releases 4-11 through 4-13 had the following
    problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a port was multi-device and auto-connect, and was only accessed using SyncIO
      calls, then asynManager would never connect to the devices. If regular queued requests
      were used, which happens if an asyn record is connected to that port and device,
      then it would connect once the first queue request was done.</li>
    <li>For all auto-connect ports there was a race condition, such that the port might
      or might not be connected when the first queued request or SyncIO call was done
      on that port. This arose because when the port registered its asynCommon interface,
      asynManager queued a connection request on that port. But if that connection request
      callback, which executes in the portThread, had not yet occurred when a queue request
      or SyncIO call was made, then those operations would be rejected because the port
      was not yet connected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These problems were fixed by doing the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the port registers its asynCommon interface and asynManager queues the connection
      request, it now waits for a short time for the connection callback to complete.
      The default time is 0.5 seconds, but this time can be changed with a call to the
      new function pasynManager-&gt;setAutoConnectTimeout(double timeout). This function
      can be accessed from the iocsh shell with the new asynSetAutoConnectTimeout(double
      timeout) command. This short timeout is designed to allow devices time to connect
      if they are available, but not to excessively slow down booting of the IOC by waiting,
      for example, for the system timeout on TCP connections. Note that this change means
      that it is now very likely that the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() call will occur as
      soon as the asynCommon interface is registered. As noted in the R4-12 release notes,
      this means that the driver must have already done all initialization required for
      the asynCommon-&gt;connect() callback before it registers the asynCommon interface!</li>
    <li>There is an additional new function, pasynManager-&gt;waitConnect(asynUser *pasynUser,
      double timeout), which will wait for the for the port to connect, up to the specified
      timeout. This function can be called from the iocsh with the new command asynWaitConnect(const
      char *portName, double timeout). This function makes it possible to wait longer
      for a port to connect then the current value of the global autoconnect timeout described
      above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fixed problems with the SyncIO calls, which were caused by the implementation of
    pasynManager-&gt;lockPort():</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The SyncIO calls (e.g. asynOctetSyncIO) are implemented by calling pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(),
      executing the I/O in the current thread, and then calling pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort().
      These SyncIO functions are designed to be called from threads that are allowed to
      block, such as SNL programs, or other drivers. The problem with the previous implementation
      was that pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() immediately took the port mutex when it was
      available, rather than queueing a request to take the mutex. This could lead to
      one thread effectively getting exclusive access to the port, even if other threads
      had queued requests or tried to do SyncIO calls themselves. For example, if a device
      could send unsolicited input, then one might create a thread that simply called
      pasynOctetSyncIO-&gt;read() with a short timeout in a tight loop. The problem with
      this was that as soon as that thread released the port mutex when the read timed
      out, it would take the mutex again, blocking other threads that were trying to access
      the port.&nbsp; Previously the only solution to this problem was to add a short
      epicsThreadSleep() in the read loop.</li>
    <li>This problem has been fixed by reimplementing pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(), which
      now queues a request to access the port and then blocks until the queue request
      callback runs in the portThread. When the queue request runs, the thread that called
      pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() executes, and the portThread blocks, until pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort()
      is called.</li>
    <li>Note that this change to lockPort() does change its functionality in one respect:
      previously it was OK to call lockPort() on a port that was not connected. This is
      no longer possible, because the queueRequest call in lockPort will now return an
      error if the port is not connected.</li>
    <li>The change to lockPort did not require any changes to the asynXXXSyncIO functions
      except asynCommonSyncIO. The asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice and asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice
      calls cannot use lockPort() any more, because as noted above it does not work with
      disconnected ports. Rather, these functions now directly queue a connection request
      with a private callback function to connect or disconnect the port.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    vxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in driver initialization. The driver had not completed all required
    initialization before it called pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort. Because pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort
    registers the asynCommon interface, that now normally triggers an immediate callback
    to vxiConnect, and the driver was not yet properly initialized to handle that callback.</p>
  <p>
    Added an additional example driver, asynPortTest, that uses asynPortDriver. It implements
    the asynInt32, asynFloat64, and asynOctet interfaces to communicate with the echo
    server using asynOctetSyncIO calls. This tests nested SyncIO calls. Added a new
    startup script, database and medm screen for testing this new driver.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Added a call to asynOctet-&gt;flush() just before the call to asynOctet-&gt;write()
    operation when doing write/read operations. This eliminates any stale input that
    may have already been sent by the device and would otherwise be incorrectly returned
    by the read operation.</p>
  <h3>
    interposeEOS</h3>
  <p>
    Now behaves properly even when eomReason is NULL.</p>
  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Changed ipEchoServer2.c to eliminate the epicsThreadSleep(0.01) in the listener
    thread. This sleep is no longer necessary because of the change to lockPort described
    above, so the example program was changed to test and demonstrate this.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-13-1</h2>
    <h2>
      May 20, 2010</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug in getXXXParam. It was not returning error status when a parameter was
    undefined. This caused device support to use undefined values for output records,
    because the initial read from the driver during device support initialization did
    not return an error it should have.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-13</h2>
    <h2>
      April 1, 2010</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asyn/Makefile</h3>
  <p>
    Change some dependencies to fix parallel (-j) make problem.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    A return of 0 from a read of a TCP stream is treated as an END condition rather
    than as an error. This makes it easier to handle devices that close the connection
    at the end of a reply.</p>
  <p>
    Support has been added for devices such as web servers that require a connect at
    the beginning of each transaction. To enable this behaviour, specify "http" as the
    protocol in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command and ensure that each transaction
    ends with a read that detects the broken connection from the device. Note that the
    device will always appear connected. The connect/disconnect around each transaction
    is handled within the drvAsynIPPort driver.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPServerPort</h3>
  <p>
    Corrected the documentation to state that only the TCP/IP protocol is supported,
    not UDP.</p>
  <h3>
    asynGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fix problem with NULL-pointer dereferences.</p>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Bug fix from Benjamin Franksen for devices that don't support IRQ.
  </p>
  <h3>
    devEPICS</h3>
  <p>
    The ring buffer code in devAsynFloat64.c, devAsynInt32.c and devAsynUInt32Digital.c
    has been improved. Previously when ring buffer overflow occurred during a callback
    the new value was simply discarded. This meant that when the record processed at
    the end of a rapid burst of callbacks it would not contain the most recent value.
    Now when overflow occurs the oldest value is removed from from the ring buffer and
    the new value is added, so that the record will contain the most recent callback
    value after a burst.</p>
  <p>
    asynUInt32Digital: asynMask values implying shifts greater than 16 bits are now
    supported.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug which caused an error when writing or reading in binary format if the
    driver did not implement the get(Input/Output)Eos functions. This bug was introduced
    when readRaw and writeRaw were removed from asynOctet in release 4-10.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Additional makeSupport.pl template</h3>
  <p>
    makeSupport.pl -t streamSCPI &lt;name&gt; creates skeleton stream protocol and database
    files for a SCPI (IEEE-488.2) device.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug in readInt32Array, not taking lock where needed.</p>
  <p>
    Added drvInfo strings to parameter lists, and new methods to support this: createParam(),
    findParam(), getParamName(). The report functions now print out the drvInfo strings,
    which is very useful. The base class drvUserCreate() method can now be used without
    reimplementing in derived classes, because the parameter names are now available
    to the base class. Removed asynParamString_T and drvUserCreateParam(), which are
    no longer needed. The testAsynPortDriver test application has been updated to use
    these new features.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-12</h2>
    <h2>
      August 19, 2009</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    A problem was introduced in R4-11 by not starting the autoconnect process until
    iocInit(), and operations that do not use the XXXSyncIO functions thus fail before
    iocInit(). This means, for example, that calls to asynSetOption() to set serial
    port parameters fail if done in a startup script before iocInit(). R4-12 fixes this
    problem by decoupling autoconnect operations from iocInit(). NOTE: The first call
    to the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() function now happens almost immediately after pasynManager-&gt;registerInterface()
    is called for the asynCommon interface. This timing is different from all previous
    asyn releases, and it means that port drivers must initialize everything required
    by asynCommon-&gt;connect() before they register the asynCommon interface. This
    may require minor re-ordering of the initialization sequence in some drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Requests to set end-of-string values or serial port parameters are accepted even
    when the port is not connected. The request takes effect when the port is connected.
    This makes IOC startup more robust in the face of network or USB to serial adapters
    that may be unavailable on startup.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInt32Average, asynFloat64Average</h3>
  <p>
    If record is processed before new data have arrived (numAverage==0) set record to
    UDF/INVALID, set UDF to TRUE and leave value unchanged.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-11</h2>
    <h2>
      June 16, 2009</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    asynReport at detail level 0 now reports only disconnected subaddresses.</p>
  <p>
    The autoconnect code has undergone considerable modification. When a port is registered
    with autoConnect true, or whenever a port disconnect exception is raised on an autoConnect
    port, an attempt at connection occurs immediately followed by retry attempts at
    20 second intervals. Attempts to queue requests to a disconnected port (even an
    autoConnect port) will be rejected. These changes have been made to reduce the occurences
    of 'connection flurries' and to ensure that requests do not languish in the queue
    when connections are broken.</p>
  <p>
    Setting the trace mask or trace I/O mask for a port now also sets the trace mask
    or trace I/O mask for every device associated with that port.</p>
  <p>
    Passing a NULL pasynUser argument to the setTraceMask and setTraceIOMask will set
    the asynBase (default) trace mask or trace I/O mask. To do this from the iocsh pass
    a zero length portName string to the iocsh commands asynSetTraceMask or asynSetTraceIOMask.</p>
  <h3>
    asynDriver.h</h3>
  <p>
    Add new version macros (ASYN_VERSION, ASYN_REVISION and ASYN_MODIFICATION). These
    are guaranteed to be numeric.</p>
  <p>
    Add new asynStatus codes, <strong>asynDisconnected</strong> and <strong>asynDisabled</strong>.
    Attempts to queue a request to a disconnected or disabled port return these codes,
    respectively. Future changes to record support may propogate these to the record
    alarm status field.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEOS</h3>
  <p>
    Increased the size of the input buffer from 600 to 2048 bytes.</p>
  <h3>
    VXI-11</h3>
  <p>
    Fix from Takashi Asakawa, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Japan to allow link identifiers
    with a value of zero.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics (devAsynInt32, devAsynFloat64, devAsynUInt32Digital)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignore callbacks when interruptAccept=0, because waiting for interruptAccept (the
      previous behavior) hangs iocInit with synchronous drivers. The first record process
      on input records will now read directly from driver, which will get the latest value.</li>
    <li>Added mutex around epicsRingBytes calls</li>
    <li>Added ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE when reading value from ring buffer</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Add some cleanup code to eliminate memory/socket leaks.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO</h3>
  <p>
    The asynOctetSyncIO <strong>openSocket</strong> method will be removed in the next
    release. This method is redundant since it is no different than calling the <strong>
      connect</strong> method with the port name from a previous drvAsynIPPortConfigure
    command.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    A new C++ base class called <strong>asynPortDriver</strong> from which real asyn
    port drivers can be derived. It greatly simplifies the code required to write a
    new asyn port driver. It is documented <a href="asynPortDriver.html">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>
    testAsynPortDriverApp</h3>
  <p>
    A new test application to demonstrate the use of the new asynPortDriver C++ class.
    This driver simulates a simple digital oscilloscope, and includes a C++ driver,
    EPICS database, medm screen, and an example iocBoot directory in ioctestAsynPortDriver.
    It is described in the documentation for <a href="asynPortDriver.html">asynPortDriver</a>.</p>

  <h3>
    asynOctet</h3>
  <p>
    Ths asynOctet <strong>writeRaw</strong> and <strong>readRaw</strong> methods have
    been removed. In most cases, if your code now calls readRaw or writeRaw it should
    be safe to simply change these calls to their non-Raw equivalent. If you're paranoid
    about someone interposing the end-of-string processing layer you could add something
    like the following to ensure that there is no end-of-string to match:</p>
  <pre>pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);</pre>
  <p>
    If you need to switch to 'raw' mode for a while and then back to 'eos mode', you
    can use code similar to that in devGpib.c:readArbitraryBlockProgramData:</p>
  <pre>char saveEosBuf[5];
int saveEosLen;
.
.
.
status = pasynOctet-&gt;getInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,saveEosBuf,sizeof saveEosBuf,&amp;saveEosLen);
if (status != asynSuccess) {
    epicsSnprintf(pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage,pasynUser-&gt;errorMessageSize,"Device EOS too long!");
    return -1;
}
if (saveEosLen)
pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);
.

    When compiling your code against this new version of asyn you should pay particular
    attention to warning messages of the form "warning: initialization from incompatible
    pointer type". These are a good indication that you're initializing an <strong>asynOctet</strong>
    structure with the old-style I/O methods.</p>

  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Add a strStatus method to convert an asynStatus code to a string.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Cleaned up timeout handling.</p>
  <p>
    Fix memory leak (one epicsAtExit entry was allocated for every connect).</p>
  <p>
    asynReport no longer reports as connected a port which has successfully disconnected.</p>
  <p>
    Improved diagnostic messages.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPServerPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs that caused the thread that listened for new connections to exit when
    errors occurred. Such errors included too many simultaneous connections.</p>
  <h3>
    interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added three new array interfaces, asynInt8Array, asynInt16Array, and asynFloat32Array.
    asynInt8Array and asynInt16Array are the same as asynInt32Array except that the
    data types are for epicsInt8 and epicsInt16 respectively. asynFloat32Array is the
    same as asynFloat64Array except that the data type is for epicsFloat32.</p>
  <p>
    Added asyn(XXX)ArraySyncIO for synchronous I/O to all array interfaces.</p>
  <p>
    Added new asynGenericPointer interface. The datatype for this interface is void*,
    so it can be used to pass a pointer to anything. Includes asynGenericPointerSyncIO
    for synchronous I/O.</p>
  <p>
    Added asynStandardInterfaces.h and asynStandardInterfacesBase.c to simplify driver
    initialization when using the standard asyn interfaces defined in asyn/interfaces
    (common, octet, int32, etc.)</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Undid the change that was done in R4-9 with direct calls to dbScanLock and process
    in the interrupt callback functions. This could lead to deadlocks in some circumstances.
    The original reason for changing from scanIoRequest to (dbScanLock, process) was
    because callback values would be lost if the callbacks came so close together in
    time that the single callback value stored in device support was overwritten before
    scanIoRequest could process the record. This problem has been fixed by adding a
    FIFO (ring buffer) to the device support for the scalar interfaces asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital,
    and asynFloat64. The ring buffer is only created when the record is put into I/O
    Intr scan, so the storage is not allocated for records that are not I/O Intr scanned.
    The ring buffer default size is 10 values, but this can be changed on a per-record
    basis using the dbInfo string "FIFO" with a value such as "100".</p>
  <p>
    Added support for bi and bo records for asynInt32 interface. Previously these records
    were only supported for the asynUInt32Digital interface.</p>
  <p>
    Added waveform record device support for the asynInt8Array, asynInt16Array, and
    asynFloat32Array interfaces. These are the same as devAsynInt32Array and devAsynFloat64Array
    with changes to the data types.</p>
  <h3>
    asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    Remove duplicate windows function decorations.</p>

      Release 4-9</h2>
    <h2>
      October 19, 2007</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Replaced scanIoRequest with direct call to rset-&gt;process in interrupt callback
    routines in all device support. Without this fix if another interrupt occurred before
    the first scanIoRequest was complete bad things could happen. The data from the
    first interrupt would be lost, and the read function in the driver would be called
    when it should not have been.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for 28,800 baud for those architectures which support this unusual
    speed.</p>
  <p>
    Added stub routines for WIN32 so that a separate DBD file is no longer needed.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIpPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added short delay in cleanup routine so sockets would close cleanly.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEos.c</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug which caused asynOctetRead() to return prematurely with eomReason=ASYN_EOM_CNT
    if the port driver returned 600 bytes in readRaw().</p>
  <h3>
    RTEMS</h3>
  <p>
    Build driver for Greensprings IP-488 if IPAC is defined in configure/RELEASE.</p>
  <h3>
    VXI11</h3>
  <p>
    Added stub routines for WIN32 so that a separate DBD file is no longer needed.</p>
  <h3>
    VXI-11</h3>
  <p>
    Avoid duplicate clnt_destroy operations.</p>

      Release 4-8</h2>
    <h2>
      April 28, 2007</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    devEpics/devAsynInt32</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for link specification of</p>
  <pre>@asynMask(portName,addr,nbits,timeout)drvParams</pre>
  <p>
    in addition to the previous support for</p>
  <pre>@asyn(portName,addr,timeout)drvParams</pre>
  <p>
    This allows device support to work with drivers that cannot return meaningful values
    in pasynInt32-&gt;getBounds because they do not know the range of the device. This
    is true, for example of Modbus ADCs. The nbits parameter is defined as follows:</p>
  <pre>  nbits &gt; 0  Device is unipolar with a range from 0 to 2^nbits-1
  nbits &lt; 0  Device is bipolar with a range from -2^(abs(nbits)-1) to 2^((abs(nbits)-1)-1
           Values returned on the asynInt32 interface will be sign extended
           using the sign bit (e.g. bit abs(nbits)-1 starting at bit 0).
  </pre>
  <h3>
    devEpics/devAsynInt32Array, devAsynFloat64Array</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for callbacks from driver to device support. This allows waveform
    records to have I/O Intr scanning, as already supported for other records in devEpics.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics/asynEpicsUtils</h3>
  <p>
    Changed parser so it requires an exact match to "asyn(" or "asynMask(". Previously
    it tolerated other characters before the "(", and in particular it accepted "asynMask("
    when "asyn(" was expected. Note that this change could cause problems with database
    files if they did not follow the documented syntax, which has no white space between
    "asyn" or "asynMask" and the "(" character.</p>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fix errors in format strings for asynPrint.</p>
  <p>
    Temporary fix to asynReport thread for Cygwin. If the amount of output is small
    the thread exists for a very short time, and this causes a crash. The fix is a short
    wait, but it should really be fixed in base/src/libCom/osi/os/posix/osdThread.c.</p>
  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Fix problem with Makefile.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Add more SCPI commands to devGpib template.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Close sockets on application exit. This is very important for vxWorks, otherwise
    sockets are not closed cleanly which often leads to problems when the IOC reboots.</p>
  <h3>
    drvGsIP488</h3>

    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Clean up operation on POSIX/termios systems (everything but vxWorks). The old mechanism
    was prone to polling during read operations rather than using the termios read timeout
    mechanism.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>

    Fixed null pointer dereference for all device support when SCAN=I/O Intr and asyn
    port could not be found.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed buffer overflow error when NRRD&gt;40 and IFMT=ASCII.</p>
  <h3>

    *eomReason now set to ASYN_EOM_CNT when read count has been satisfied.</p>
  <p>
    Fix timeout settings on RTEMS.</p>
  <p>
    Add support for UDP broadcasts. Specify "UDP*" and the network broadcast address
    in the port configuration command:<br />
    <code>drvAsynIPPortConfigure("L0", "192.168.1.255:1234 UDP*", 0, 0, 0)</code></p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Full support for new timeout semantics (timeout&lt;0 means "wait forever for characters
    to arrive", timeout=0 means "return characters immediately available", timeout&gt;0
    means "return a timeout status if no characters are received within the specified
    number of seconds").</p>

    <h2>
      Release 4-6</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort/drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed NULL pointer dereference.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Previous versions of drvAsynIPPort.c (1.29 and earlier, asyn R4-5 and earlier) attempted
    to allow 2 things:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use an EPICS timer to time-out an I/O operation, such as send(), recv() and connect().</li>
    <li>Periodically check (every 5 seconds) during a long I/O operation to see if the
      operation should be cancelled.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Item 1) above was not really implemented because there is no portable robust way
    to abort a pending I/O operation. So the timer set a flag which was checked after
    the poll() was complete to see if the timeout had occured. This was not robust,
    because there were competing timers (timeout timer and poll) which could fire in
    the wrong order.</p>
  <p>
    Item 2) was not implemented, because asyn has no mechanism to issue a cancel request
    to a driver which is blocked on an I/O operation.</p>
  <p>
    Since neither of these mechanisms was working as designed, the driver has been re-written
    to simplify it. If one or both of these are to be implemented in the future the
    code as of version 1.29 should be used as the starting point.</p>
  <p>
    If pasynUser-&gt;timeout &lt; 0 an infinite timeout is now used.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug so that ports connected with a file descriptor in pasynUser-&gt;reason
    execute code to set timeouts.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug to return error if pasynCommon-&gt;connect is called when port already
    connected.</p>
  <h3>
    asynTrace</h3>
  <p>
    Added two new functions which are related to pasynTrace-&gt;print and pasynTrace-&gt;printIO
    the way vprintf is related to printf.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprint Same as pasynTrace-&gt;print except that instead of a variable
      of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprintIO Same as pasynTrace-&gt;printIO except that instead of
      a variable of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Changed pasynManager-&gt;connectDevice for ports which have the properties autoConnect=1
    and isConnected=0. In this case a request is queued to call asynCommon-&gt;connect
    for that port. This ensures that ports that have a pasynUser connected to them will
    report being connected even if no I/O has yet been done. Previously such ports reported
    a disconnected state until the first I/O or operation such as setTraceMask. This
    was confusing.</p>
  <p>
    Clarify documentation on meaning of pasynUser-&gt;timeout. Previously there was
    no documented method of specifying an "infinite" timeout to a driver, and the meaning
    of timeout=0.0 was not defined. The new definitions are:</p>
  <p>
    &gt; 0.0 Wait for up to timeout seconds for the I/O to complete</p>
  <p>
    = 0.0 Peform any I/O that can be done without blocking. Return timeout error if
    no I/O can be done without blocking.</p>
  <p>
    &lt; 0.0 Infinite timeout. Wait forever for I/O to complete.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs with asynFloat64Average device support. The wrong interrupt function
    was being called, and UDF was not being cleared.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-5</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    memMalloc/memFree</h3>
  <p>
    memMalloc was allocating the amount of memory the caller requested rather than the
    amount required for the freeList. If memFree was called and the memory reallocated
    to a user requesting a larger size, memory corruption occured. This is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    SyncIO routines</h3>
  <p>
    If the connect call fails the asynUser is no longer freed. Instead a message is
    put into asynUser.errorMessage. The caller must call disconnect in order to free
    the storage for the asynUser.</p>
  <p>
    The SyncIO routines no longer call asynPrint if there is an error and there is a
    valid asynUser available. Rather they return an error message in pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage.
    The SyncIO*Once functions still call asynPrint for errors, because they do not have
    a way of returning an error message.</p>
  <h3>
    Serial, TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Handle 0-length write requests.</p>
  <h3>
    TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Added drvAsynIPServerPort to support TCP and UDP socket servers.</p>
  <p>
    Added iocBoot/testIPServer to test TCP server support.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort now closes TCP sockets when remote system closes connection.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort connect function now uses pasynUser-&gt;reason as a file descriptor
    if it is &gt; 0. This allows drvAsynIPServerPort to re-use asyn ports it creates.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0. It was not setting eomReason at all
    previously.</p>
  <h3>
    Serial</h3>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynSerialPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynSerialPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0. It was not setting eomReason
    at all previously.</p>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added asynCommonSyncIO for synchronous support of the asynCommon interface.</p>
  <h3>
    VME GPIB</h3>
  <p>
    Add delay loops to get these boards to work with faster VME CPU modules.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-4</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    VXI11</h3>
  <p>
    Better support was provided for VXI-11.3 controllers, i.e. talking directly to an
    ethernet port on an instrument. In particular a TDS3054B was tested.</p>
  <p>
    WARNING: The VXI-11.1 ansd VXI-11.3 standards do NOT allow access to GPIB lines,
    i.e. conmmands like Untalk/Unlisten are not possible. The previous support issued
    these commands after each read or write. Some really old GPIB devices may fail.
    If so the device specific code must be modified to sent these commands separately.</p>
  <h3>
    win32</h3>
  <p>
    Changes were made to allow asyn to build on native Windows (win32-x86) architecture.</p>
  <p>
    There are two asyn components that do not yet work on win32-x86.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Local serial ports. The asyn uses the "termios" API for serial ports, and termios
      is not available for native Windows.</li>
    <li>VXI-11. The asyn VXI-11 support uses the Sun XDR API, which is not available for
      native Windows.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Users who want to use local serial ports or VXI-11 on Windows can use the Cygwin
    EPICS build (cygwin-x86).</p>
  <h3>

    asynManager</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>lock/unlock renamed to blockProcessCallback/unblockProcessCallback
      <p>
        The names have been changed and now these methods only work for asynchronous ports.
        An error is returned if blockProcessCallback is called for a synchronous port.</p>
    </li>
    <li>lockPort/unlockPort
      <p>
        These are new asynManager methods. They can be used in place of queueRequest if
        the caller can block. They have been added to make it easier to implement a driver
        with one addressing scheme that is a asynUser of a driver with a different addressing
        scheme. For example a multi-drop serial driver can be implemented that calls a standard
        serial driver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>asynLockPortNotify
      <p>
        This is a new interface for driver's that call other drivers.</p>

  <p>
    Yevgeny A. Gusev has again reported some hard to recognize bugs. He must have spent
    many hours looking at the code. His extra set of very good eyes are much appreciated!!.
    He also thought of the way to handle support that uses one addressing scheme but
    wants to use support that has a different addressing scheme. For example support
    for mult-drop serial that wants to use the standard serial support</p>

  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort - serial port options</h3>
  <p>
    Changes were made to the way serial port options are handled.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>initial values
      <p>
        Previosly defaults were assigned for all options. Now the initial values are fetched
        from either the termios (POSIX) or sioLib (vxWorks).</p>
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>vxWorks clocal and crtscts
      <p>
        The vxWorks sioLib uses clocal for what POSIX calls crtscts. The new serial support
        for vxWorks accepts both clocal and crtscts to specify RTSCTS (Request to send,
        Clear to send).</p>

    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <p>
    APOLOGY: Many interfaces have changed since release 3-3. This is the reason this
    release is called 4-0.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>asynManager - Only report has changed. Many new methods have been added. asynManager:report
      takes an additional parameter, portName.</li>
    <li>asynOctet - The read/write methods are similar to before. The new version has
      sepearate end of string methods for input and output.</li>
    <li>register based interfaces - Extensive changes have occured.</li>
    <li>devGpib - Unless special conversion routines call low level drivers, debGpib support
      should work without any changes.</li>
    <li>devEpics -
      <ul>
        <li>Extensive changes have occured. The support naming now follows the names of asyn
          interfaces. For example devAsynInt32 contains device support for interface asynInt32.</li>
        <li>device definitions have changed.
          <p>
            Blanks no longer appear in the menu choices. For example.</p>
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,devAiAsynInt32,"asyn Int32")
       </pre>
          is now
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,asynAiInt32,"asynInt32")
       </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynOctetSyncIO
      <ul>
        <li>All read and write methods now return asynStatus and have additional args to return
          the number of bytes sent/received.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>The IEOS and OEOS fields are set to the current values for the port when the record
          connects to the port. If they are modified after the record connects to the port,
          then the EOS strings will be changed using asynOctet-&gt;setOutputEos or asynOctet-&gt;setIbputEos.
          IMPORTANT: The values of IEOS and OEOS in the database file are never used, because
          they are modified when the record connects to the port.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>interrupt support -A major new feature is support for interrupts. See asynDriver.html
      for details.</li>
    <li>linuxGpib - This is support for the linuxGpib open source project. It contains
      support for many linux gpib kernel drivers. The asyn support was provided by Rok
      Sabjan (cosyLab).</li>
    <li>cancelRequest - If cancelRequest is called while either the process or timeout
      callback is active, it now waits until the callback completes.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>Added PCNCT field to connect/disconnect from port, and to indicate if port is
          currently connected.</li>
        <li>Added DRVINFO and REASON fields to provide control for the drvUser interface.</li>
        <li>Added support for register interfaces (asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital, and asynFloat64).
          New I/O fields for this support are I32INP, I32OUT, UI32INP, UI32OUT, UI32MASK,
          F64INP, and F64OUT. The new IFACE field is used to select the currently active interface.</li>
        <li>Added new fields to indicate if a particular interface is supported by the driver.
          These fields are OCTETIV, I32IV, UI32IV, F64IV, OPTIONIV, and GPIBIV.</li>
        <li>Added support for I/O Intr scanning for any driver/interface that supports callbacks.
          asynOctet does not yet support callbacks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 3-3</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>MAY BE MORE - This release has major new features. Implementing the new features
      may have caused some imcompatibilities, This list is likely to grow as existing
      users report problems.</li>
    <li>queueRequest - If the portDriver does not block then the queue callback is called
      by queueRequest rather than by a separate thread. User code can call canBlock to
      find out how the callback is called.</li>
    <li>registerPort - The argument multiDevice has been replaced by attributes. Attributes
      currently has two bits ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK. The port driver is responsible
      for setting both bits correctly.</li>
    <li>setOption/getOption have been moved from asynCommon to a new interface asynOption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Support for register based drivers.
      <ul>
        <li>Generic register based device support for EPICS records.</li>
        <li>Additional fields have been added to asynUser.</li>
        <li>Added pasynManager-&gt;memMalloc() and pasynManager-&gt;memFree() for allocating
          and freeing memory with a freelist. This is primarily meant to be used with pasynManager-&gt;duplicateAsynUser()
          and the new pasynUser-&gt;userData field.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynDriver.h</h3>
  <p>
    The following changes have been made</p>
  <ul>
    <li>userData - this is a new field in asynUser.</li>
    <li>registerPort - Field multiDevice is replaced by attributes. Currently two attributes
      are defined: ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK.</li>
    <li>duplicateAsynUser - This is a new method that creates a new asynUser and initializes
      it with values from an existing asynUser. freeAsynUser now puts the asynUser of
      a free list rather than calling free.</li>
    <li>memMalloc/memFree - New methods that manage storage. It uses a set of free lists
      of different sizes.</li>
    <li>asynCommon no longer has methods setOption/getOption.</li>
    <li>asynOctet is now defined in a separate header file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Removed the GOPT field. This is no longer necessary because the port options are
    automatically read whenever connecting to a port. "special" requests are now queued
    without changing the state of the record, using the new duplicateAsynUser, memMalloc(),
    and memFree() methods. This means that there is no longer a possibility of a special
    request being rejected because the record is busy. It is no longer possible to cancel
    a special request.</p>
  <h3>
    asynGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>asynGpibPort:srqStatus returns asynStatus</li>
    <li>asynGpibPort:serialPoll returns asynStatus. It now only calls a registered callback
      only if statusByte&amp;0x40 is non zero.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    devSupportGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>setEos is now a method.</li>
    <li>completeProcess is a new method. This was added to support synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Failures for GPIBREADW|GPIBEFASTIW were not handled properly. This could cause
      and assert failure. This is fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortFlush</h3>
  <p>
    Flushes input only.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEOS</h3>
  <p>
    The EOS read method now calls the low-level read method only once and returns as
    many characters as the low-level method supplies. This makes the EOS read semantics
    match those of the low-level serial and IP drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    vxi11SetRpcTimeout - now handles fractions of a second properly</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    A new field has beem added, AQR (Abort Queue Request)</p>
  <p>
    The semantics have been changed as follows: process is responsible for all and only
    for I/O operations. Only I/O operations cause the alarm status and severity to change.
    Special is responsible for all other operations performed by asynRecord.</p>

      Release 3-2</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE --</strong> The units of the <code>respond2Writes</code>
      field, if greater than 0, are now seconds rather than milliseconds. This change
      was made so that all time values set in the instrument support initialization routine
      are specified uniformly in units of seconds. Very few instrument support files are
      likely to be affected by this change</li>
    <li>The contents of asynRecDevDrv.dbd have been placed in asyn.dbd and asynRecDevDrv.dbd
      has been removed. This allows applications to get correct dbior reports and access
      to asynRecords by including any low-level driver .dbd file.</li>
    <li>The drvAsynTCPPort driver has been renamed drvAsynIPPort since it now supports
      both UDP and TCP protocols. The protocol is selected by adding a "UDP" or "TCP"
      after the "hostname:port" in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command. A missing protocol
      is taken to be "TCP".</li>
    <li>Work around 'missing SPD' bug in HP E2050 GPIB/LAN adapter. SRQ handling is much
      more robust on all supported hardware.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>National Instruments NI1014 VME GPIB interface is now supported.</li>
    <li>GPIB - All low level GPIB support (vxi11, gsip488, and ni1014) now fully support
      the GPIB specific features defined by asynGpibDriver.h</li>
    <li>Implementation of asynTrace is more consistent across the low level drivers.</li>
    <li>Added makeSupport script and template instrument support. Updated tutorials to
      reflect these additions.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 3-1</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The drvGenericSerial driver has been split into drvAsynSerialPort and drvAsynTCPPort
      drivers for local and remote serial ports, respectively. End-of-string processing
      has been moved to an interposed interface.</li>
    <li>The diagnostic facilities previously provided by asynTrace.db have been replaced
      with the much more general asynRecord.db</li>
    <li>All asynManager,asynCommon, and asynOctet methods except report now return asynStatus.
      Methods that previously returned a different value now have an additional argument
      for this value.</li>
    <li>Low-level driver read and write methods now return asynStatus and are passed an
      additional argument through which they store the actual number of characters read
      or written.</li>
    <li>The createSocket method in the asynSyncIO interface has been replaced by openSocket.
      openSocket does not call asynSyncIO-&gt;connect(), that must now be done by the
      caller.</li>
    <li>Removed code for "flush" from gpib drivers. The implementation caused infinite
      loops on devices that speak when not spoken to.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>asynOctetRecord has been renamed to asynRecord</li>
        <li>TIOM, TMSK, TSIZ, TFIL, AUCT, ENBL, CNCT, ERRS, TINP, NAWT fields have been added</li>
        <li>Default values of OMAX and IMAX decreased from 512 to 80</li>
        <li>Options that are unknown for a device (e.g. baud on a Moxa terminal server) are
          shown as Unknown.</li>
        <li>Many bug fixes and improvements in logic and functionality</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
    <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
    <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>

    <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Testing</h3>
  <p>
    The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris, Linux (redhat
    9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been tested with the following
    vxi11 controllers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
      <p>
        It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
    </li>
    <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
    <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
      <p>
        When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2 rather than a
        VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address. SRQs did not work when
        connecting via the ethernet port but did when communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME carrier.</li>
    <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
    <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
    <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa NPort Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support: DG535
    and TDS3014B Scope.</p>

To start the ioc from this directory execute the command
    ../../bin/_TARGETARCH_/<appname> st.cmd

Alternatively make the st.cmd file directly executable with
    chmod +x st.cmd
and check the executable name on the first line of the st.cmd file.

You may need to change the name of the .dbd and .db files in the st.cmd's
dbLoadDatabase() commands and of the registerRecordDeviceDriver routine before
starting the ioc.

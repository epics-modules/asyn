<h2>Release 1-0alpha2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Support Provided in addition to asynDriver and asynGpib</h3>
<ul>
  <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
  <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
  <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to
    Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Other device support methods especially streams, devSerial, and
    mpfSerial.</li>
  <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris,
Linux (redhat 9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been
tested with the following vxi11 controllers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
    <p>It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
  </li>
  <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
  <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
    <p>When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2
    rather than a VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address.
    SRQs did not work when connecting via the ethernet port but did when
    communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME
    carrier.</li>
  <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port
  (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
  <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
  <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa
    NPort Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>
Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support:
DG535 and TDS3014B Scope.</body>

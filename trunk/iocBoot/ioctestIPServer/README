This IOC uses the code in testIPServer/ directory.

It creates 2 socket listener ports on localhost.  Port 5001 allows 2 simultaneous connections
port 5002 allows only a single connection.  

The port 5001 servers run the ipEchoServer.c code, and simply echo all input
revieved on the port back to the output on that port.

The port 5002 server run the ipSNCServer.st code.  It receives input commands
and sends the response "OK" to every command.  It updates 3 EPICS PVs
$(P)connected is a bi record with the connection status
$(P)stringInput is a stringin record with the string received from the IP client
$(P)stringOutput is a stringin record with the string sent to the IP client.

medm/ipSNCServer.adl is an medm screen that can used to view these PVs.

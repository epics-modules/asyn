<h1>asynDriver: Asynchronous Driver Support - Known Problems</h1>

<h1>November 22 2004</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 4-0</h2>
</center>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>
<p>asynRecord (and other code) use epicsStrSnPrintEscaped.  The version
in base 3.14.6 has a buffer overflow problem that can lead to
corruption.  In fact it is guaranteed to lead to corruption in
asynRecord if the received string is longer than 40 characters.<p>

<h3>asynManager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>removeInterruptUser - has not been tested</li>
  <li>addInterruptUser/removeInterruptUser are not allowed to be called from
    interrupt callbacks. This restriction should be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>vxi11</h3>
<ul>
  <li>E5810 reboot -
    <p>John Sinclair (ONRL) reported that the IOC crashed if an E5810 was
    power cycled. This could not be reproduced at APS. We will have to see if
    it is still a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>E5810 serial port -
    <p>Attempts to provide support for the serial port of a E5810 have not
    been successful</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-3</h2>
</center>

<h3>vxi11Configure</h3>

<p>If vxiName is specified as <span
style="font-family: courier">"inst"</span> then the driver incorrectly says
that it does not block.</p>

<h3>asynRecord</h3>

<p>If asynRecord is attached to a port that does not implement asynOctet,
then asynRecord crashes of it attempt to send/receive a message.</p>

<h3>asynManager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a queueRequest timeout hangs if the timeout is canceled while the
    timout callback is active.</li>
  <li>cancelRequest also has possible race conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The next release gaurantees that when queueRequest is called:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exactly one of the following occurs:
    <ul>
      <li>queue callback is called</li>
      <li>timeout callback is called</li>
      <li>cancelRequest removes the request before either queue callback or
        timeout callback is called.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If either the queue or timeout callback is active when cancelRequest is
    called, it will not return until the callback completes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Release 3-2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Mac OS X (Darwin)</h3>

<p>The RPC library on Mac OS X 10.3.3 does not handle device timeouts
properly and may cause core dumps.  A bug report has been filed with Apple. A
workaround is to use the GNU glibc RPC/XDR routines.</p>

<h3>vxWorks</h3>

<p>Attempting to change the trace file to "stdout" does not work becuase
vxWorks has per-task standard output streams.</p>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>EPICS Base R3.14.6</h3>

<p>When building with EPICS Base R3.14.6 or greater, comment out the
epicsInterruptibleSyscall.h and epicsInterruptibleSyscall.c lines in
asyn/Makefile:</p>

<h3>Mac OS X (Darwin)</h3>

<p>The RPC library on Mac OSD 10.3.3 does not handle device timeouts properly
and may cause core dumps.  A bug report has been filed with Apple.  A
workaround is to use the GNU glibc RPC/XDR routines.</p>

<h3>Interrupt Callback</h3>

<p>If a user callback calls a low level driver with an infinite or very long
timeout, there is no way to make the call terminate. Is there a generic way
to abort the call?</p>

<h3>Greensprings IP488</h3>

<p>Does not support GPIB specific functions.</p>

<h3>NI1014 VME Gpib driver</h3>

<p>This needs to be implemented for asynDriver.</p>

<h3>Generic EPICS device support</h3>

<p>Think about  creating generic support for connecting to EPICS records.</p>

<h3>Network Protocols</h3>

<p>Consider generic support for various network protocals: Modbus, etherIP,
etc.</p>

<h2>Release 2-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>devAsyn</h3>
<p>This currently consists of devAsyn, devAsynGeneric, and asynOctetRecord.
In the next release this is likely to be replaced by asynRecord. It will
have all the features of asynOctetRecord but will also support the
connect,enable,autoConnect features of devAsyn and devAsynGeneric.</p>
<h3>drvGenericSerial</h3>

<p>This should be broken up into two drivers. One that supports termios and
one that supports sockets. Details to be determined.</p>

<h3>flush</h3>

<p>Flush is not currently supported on vxi11 or GS IP488. Can we think of
what it would mean for 488.2?</p>

<h3>Interrupt Callback</h3>
<p>If a user callback calls a low level driver with an infinite or very long
timeout, there is no way to make the call terminate. Is there a generic
way to abort the call?</p>

<h3>NI1014 VME Gpib driver</h3>

<p>This needs to be implemented for asynDriver.</p>

<h3>Generic EPICS device support</h3>

<p>Think about  creating generic support for connecting to EPICS records.</p>

<h3>Network Protocals</h3>

<p>Consider generic support for various network protocals: Modbus, etherIP,
etc.</p>

<h3>Solaris</h3>

<h3>Mac OS X (Darwin)</h3>

<p>The RPC library on Mac OSD 10.3.3 does not handle device timeouts properly and may cause core dumps.  A bug report has been filed with Apple.  A workaround
is to use the GNU glibc RPC/XDR routines.</p>


<h3>Interrupt Callback</h3>
<p>If a user callback calls a low level driver with an infinite or very long
timeout, there is no way to make the call terminate. Is there a generic
way to abort the call?</p>

<h3>Greensprings IP488</h3>
<p>Does not support GPIB specific functions.</p>
<h3>NI1014 VME Gpib driver</h3>

<p>This needs to be implemented for asynDriver.</p>

<h3>Generic EPICS device support</h3>

<p>Think about  creating generic support for connecting to EPICS records.</p>

<h3>Network Protocals</h3>

<p>Consider generic support for various network protocals: Modbus, etherIP,
etc.</p>

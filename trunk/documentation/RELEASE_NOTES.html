    <h2>
      Release 4-23</h2>
    <h2>
      June 16, 2014</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynManager.c</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in pasynManager->memMalloc. It could return a pointer that was not a
    multiple of 8 bytes. This led to subtle problems on some architectures (e.g. ARM)
    if a double was stored in the memory returned by memMalloc. Fixed the code so the
    pointer is always a multiple of 16 bytes (for future safety).</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynUSBTMC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added driver for USB TMC (Test and Measurement Class) devices.</li>
    <li>Works on any system that provides <a href="http://libusb.info">libusb-1.0</a>.</li>
    <li>Requires no kernel modifications.</li>
    <li>Tested with StreamDevice on Darwin, Linux and Windows.</li>
    <li>Enabled by setting DRV_USBTMC=YES in configure/CONFIG_SITE.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bug: the port was not always being disconnected when the OS returned serious
    errors. This was preventing USB serial devices from disconnecting and reconnecting
    properly.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortWin32 (Windows serial port driver)</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed 2 bugs in pasynOctet-&gt;read() when pasynUserTimeout=0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It was not returning immediately, it was waiting 16 ms.</li>
    <li>If there were no characters to be read it was not returning asynTimeout, it was
      returning asynSuccess. This prevented StreamDevice from working correctly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed several 32/64 bit issues.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPServerPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for UDP servers, in addition to TCP servers. Thanks to Helge Brands
    and Dirk Zimoch from PSI for this.</p>
  <h3>
    drvLinuxGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fix to Makefile to link with system libgpib library.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics (asynInt32)</h3>
  <p>
    Sign-extend positive or unsigned values as well as negative values when DTYP=asynInt32
    and asynMask value is non-zero.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics (asynUInt32Digital)</h3>
  <p>
    Apply mask to longin and longout records.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Undid the change in R4-22 that changed the asynStdInterfaces from protected to private.
    That change was not compatible with areaDetector R1-9-1.</p>
  <p>
    Removed paramList.h and paramList.cpp, put the code into asynPortDriver.cpp. These
    two classes had many interdependencies, so needed to include each other's header
    files. This was difficult when building dynamically on Windows, where imported and
    exported symbols need to be distinguished.</p>
  <p>
    Added links to asynPortDriver.html to detailed tutorial on how to write a driver
    using asynPortDriver.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug that could cause the values of *nbytesOut, *nbytesIn, and *eomReason
    to be garbage if an I/O error occurred.</p>
  <h3>
    Many files</h3>
  <p>
    Handled exporting symbols consistently, which is important when building dynamically
    for Windows with Visual Studio. Eliminated all references to epicsSharedSymbols,
    now just #include &lt;epicsexport.h&gt; just before the #include for the header
    file that defines symbols for this file, and after all other #include statements.
    Thanks to Peter Heesterman for the initial version of this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    configure directory</h3>
  <p>
    Updated the files in the configure directory to the versions from EPICS base 3.14.12.3.
    Paths to EPICS base and other modules are still defined in configure/RELEASE. However,
    other configuration values, such as LINUX_GPIB and DRV_USBTMC are now defined in
    configure/CONFIG_SITE, not in RELEASE.</p>

    <h2>
      Release 4-22</h2>
    <h2>
      October 30, 2013</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support functions for setting timestamps in asyn port drivers. These can be
    used to set the timestamp when the port driver received data. The driver can then
    set the asynUser-&gt;timeStamp field to this value for all input records on read
    and callback operations. Records that have TSE=-2 will have this timestamp. There
    is support for registering a user-supplied function to provide the timestamp, which
    will override the default source that just calls epicsTimeGetCurrent().
  </p>
  <p>
    Added the following new functions to pasynManager for timestamp support.</p>
  <pre>asynStatus (*registerTimeStampSource)(asynUser *pasynUser, void *userPvt, timeStampCallback callback);
asynStatus (*unregisterTimeStampSource)(asynUser *pasynUser);
asynStatus (*updateTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser);
asynStatus (*getTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser, epicsTimeStamp *pTimeStamp);
asynStatus (*setTimeStamp)(asynUser *pasynUser, const epicsTimeStamp *pTimeStamp);
</pre>
  <p>
    Added the following shell commands for timestamp support.</p>
  <pre>asynRegisterTimeStampSource(const char *portName, const char *functionName);
asynUnregisterTimeStampSource(const char *portName);
   </pre>
  <p>
    Added a new bit to asynTraceMask, ASYN_TRACE_WARNING. This is intended to be used
    for messages that are less serious than ASYN_TRACE_ERROR, but more serious than
    ASYN_TRACE_FLOW.</p>
  <p>
    Added new asynTraceInfoMask. This mask controls the information printed at the beginning
    of each message by asynPrint and asynPrintIO. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen for help
    with this. The mask is defined with the following bits:</p>
  <pre>#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_TIME 0x0001
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_PORT 0x0002
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_SOURCE 0x0004
#define ASYN_TRACEINFO_THREAD 0x0008
    </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_TIME prints what has been printed in previous versions of asyn,
      the date and time of the message.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_PORT prints [port,addr,reason], where port is the port name, addr
      is the asyn address, and reason is pasynUser-&gt;reason. These are the 3 pieces
      of "addressing" information in asyn.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_SOURCE prints the file name and line number, i.e. [__FILE__,__LINE__]
      where the asynPrint statement occurs.</li>
    <li>ASYN_TRACEINFO_THREAD prints the thread name, thread ID and thread priority, i.e.
      [epicsThreadGetNameSelf(), epicsThreadGetIdSelf(), epicsThreadGetPrioritySelf()].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Added a new shell command to control this mask.</p>
  <pre>    asynSetTraceInfoMask port,addr,mask
    </pre>
  <p>
    Added asynTrace information to the output of asynReport if details &gt;=1.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO</h3>
  <p>
    Use simple lock/unlock operations rather than queueLockPort/queueUnlockPort for
    end-of-string manipulations (setInputEos, getInputEos, setOutputEos, getOutputEos).
    This ensures that these operations can take place even with the device disconnected.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Finished the support for setting the record TIME field for input records, both for
    read operations and for callback operations (i.e. records with SCAN=I/O Intr). This
    work was begun in R4-20, but it was not complete. Fixes were made in devAsynOctet,
    devAsynInt32, devAsynFloat64, and devAsynUInt32Digital.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the ring buffer overflow messages that are printed in devAsynInt32, devAsynFloat64,
    and devAsynUInt32Digital. These now use the new ASYN_TRACE_WARNING mask. Prior to
    asyn R4-20 these used ASYN_TRACE_ERROR, and in asyn R4-20 and R4-21 they used ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in calling poll(). Previously the status return from poll() was not
    being checked; it was assumed that when poll() returned the port either had new
    data or had timed out. This is not correct, because poll() can return prematurely
    with errno=EINTR if a Posix signal occurs before data is received or the timeout
    expires. This can happen, for example, when the Posix high-resolution timer routines
    (timer_create, etc.) are used in the IOC. The Prosilica vendor library uses the
    Posix timer routines, and there were problems using asyn IP ports in IOCs that were
    also running Prosilica cameras. The problem was fixed by calling poll() again if
    it returns EINTR and the desired timeout time has not expired since poll() was first
    called.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for AF_UNIX sockets on systems that provide them.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Support for all baud rates supported by the operating system.</p>
  <p>
    Fix for XON/XOFF support from Dirk Zimoch.</p>
  <h3>
    Changes to work with EPICS base 3.15</h3>
  <p>
    Removed include of asyn.dbd, from drvAsynSerialPort.dbd, drvAsynIPPort.dbd, drvVxi11.dbd,
    and drvGsIP488.dbd.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fixed Makefile rule for vxi11intr.h for parallel builds.</p>
  <h3>
    drvLinuxGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Fixes for eomReason and EOS handling from Dirk Zimoch.</p>
  <h3>
    asynOctetSyncIO interface</h3>
  <p>
    Removed the openSocket() function from this interface. This method really did not
    belong in this interface, since it just wrapped the call to drvAsynIPPortConfigure().</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Added 4 additional baud rates to the BAUD field (460800, 576000, 921600, 1152000).
    However, the BAUD field can still only support 16 fixed baud rates because it is
    type DBF_ENUM.</p>
  <p>
    Added a new LBAUD (long baud rate) field of type DBF_LONG. This allows selection
    of any baud rate, not just those in the BAUD menu. Changing the BAUD field changes
    the LBAUD field. Changing the LBAUD field changes the BAUD field to the appropriate
    selection if it is a supported value, or to "Unknown" if not.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for ASYN_TRACE_WARNING and asynTraceInfoMask, including the opi screens.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added new virtual methods to support Eos operations on the asynOctet interface.
    These are setInputEosOctet(), getInputEosOctet(), setOutputEosOctet(), getOutputEosOctet().
    Changed the report() method to print the current values of the inputEos and outputEos.</p>
  <p>
    Added new virtual methods for timestamp support. These are updateTimeStamp(), setTimeStamp(),
    getTimeStamp().</p>
  <p>
    Added new function getAsynStdInterfaces() to access the asynStdInterfaces structure,
    which is now private.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changed the functions that do callbacks when callParamCallbacks() is called to call
    pasynManager-&gt;getTimeStamp() and set the pasynUser-&gt;timestamp field to this
    value in the callbacks.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the base class readXXX() functions (e.g. readInt32(), readFloat64(), etc.)
    to call pasynManager-&gt;getTimeStamp() and set the pasynUser-&gt;timestamp field
    to this value. The readXXX() functions in derived classes should also do this, so
    that records with TSE=-2 will get the timestamp from the driver.</p>
  <h3>
    testErrorApp, iocTestErrors</h3>
  <p>
    Added an example of a user-supplied timestamp source.</p>
  <h3>
    testAsynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added calls to lock() and unlock() in simTask. This was previously a serious omission
    in this example driver. Thanks to Kay Kasemir for spotting this.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <hr />
    <h2>
      Release 4-21</h2>
    <h2>
      February 18, 2013</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Restored the original versions of pasynManager-&gt;lockPort and unlockPort that
    were used in asyn prior to R4-14. These versions just call epicsMutexLock and epicsMutexUnlock.
    In R4-14 these versions were replaced with versions that queued requests to lock
    the port. The R4-14 versions fixed a problem with the interfaces/asynXXXSyncIO functions,
    but it has become clear that the original versions are useful in some circumstances.
    The change was done as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The lockPort and unlockPort functions in R4-20 were renamed to pasynManager-&gt;queueLockPort
      and queueUnlockPort.</li>
    <li>The interfaces/asynXXXSyncIO functions were all changed to call the queueLockPort
      and queueUnlockPort, so they function identically to how they have since R4-14.</li>
    <li>The versions of lockPort and unlockPort that existed prior to R4-14 were restored
      to pasynManager.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Changed the report() function so that if details&lt;0 then asynManager does not
    print information for each device (address). It calls pasynCommon-&gt;report(-details)
    in this case so driver report functions will not be affected.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the asynTrace print, printIO, vprint, vprintIO functions so they use EPICS_PRINTF_STYLE.
    This causes the GCC (version 3.0 and higher) and clang compilers to check the agreement
    of format strings with function arguments when using asynPrint() and asynPrintIO(),
    just as they do with printf(). This is very helpful in finding errors, and uncovered
    a number in asyn itself, which have been fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Changed event code readback to support both the original 'short' VAL field (EPICS
    3.14 and earlier) and the new 'string' VAL field (EPICS 3.15 and later).</p>
  <p>
    Added support for DSET_AIRAW and DSET_AORAW definitions.</p>
  <p>
    Replace strcpy with strncpy in devCommonGpib.c to reduce possibility of errors.
    Use NELEMENTS macro in devSkeletonGpib.c rather than hardcoding. Thanks to Andrew
    Johnson for these.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Improved the initMbboDirect function in devAsynUInt32Digital.c. If an initial value
    is read successfully from the driver it now sets the .Bn fields in the record. It
    also sets VAL rather than RVAL and returns 2 rather than 0. Thanks to Andrew Johnson
    for this.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in devAsynUInt32Digital.c, which was missing a call to epicsMutexLock
    in interruptCallbackInput. Thanks to Angus Gratton for this fix.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in devAsynXXXArray.h to handle case of multiple interrupt callbacks
    between record processing. Previously this would result in a call to the asynXXXArray-&gt;read()
    in the driver, which is not correct. The asynXXXArray device support does not have
    a ring buffer, so multiple interrupt callbacks between processing results in data
    being "lost", i.e. the record processes more than once with the same data. This
    is not really an error, but we now issue an ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE warning. This is
    analogous to ring buffer overflow for non-array data types.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the "ring buffer overflow" messages from "ASYN_TRACE_ERROR" to "ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE",
    for devAsynFloat64. This was done for other device support in R4-20, but float64
    was overlooked.</p>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added writeRead and writeReadOnce functions to the asynGenericPointer interface.
    Thanks to Florian Feldbauer for this addition.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in asynCommonSyncIO that could cause a crash if the connect() function
    returned an error.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the asynOption interface. Added code to demonstrate and test this
    to the testErrors test application.</p>
  <p>
    Added new method asynPortDriver::flushOctet(), which implements asynOctet::flush().
    The base class implementation reproduces the behavior of asynOctetBase.c::flushIt,
    i.e. it calls pasynOctet-&gt;read() repeatedly with a timeout of 0.05 seconds until
    it gets no data back. But now drivers can implement their own version of flush()
    if a different behavior is desired, which was not previously possible.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the code so that the length of string parameters returned in readOctet and
    octetCallback is now strlen(string)+1, rather than strlen(string). The length thus
    now includes the terminating nil. This fixes problems with clients that request
    long strings or subscribe to monitors with a length of 0, but don't check for a
    nil terminator.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the meaning of the "details" argument in the asynPortDriver::report() function.
    The new meaning is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 = no details</li>
    <li>&gt;=1: print details for parameter list (address) 0</li>
    <li>&gt;=2: print details for all parameters lists (addresses)</li>
    <li>&gt;=3: print interrupt callback information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Changed the connect() and disconnect() methods to return an error if the device
    address specified by the pasynUser is invalid (i.e. &lt;-1 or &gt;MAX_ADDR-1).</p>
  <p>
    Fixed problem that was causing dynamic builds (e.g. SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES) to fail
    on Windows.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver/exceptions</h3>
  <p>
    Changes to allow compiling with the old vxWorks Tornado 2.0.2.1 compiler. Thanks
    to Dirk Zimoch for this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    Other</h3>
  <p>
    Many minor changes to avoid compiler warnings on Linux, vxWorks, and WIN32. Thanks
    to Dirk Zimoch for many of these.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-20</h2>
    <h2>
      August 30, 2012</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug that caused a deadlock if pasynManager-&gt;lockPort was called multiple
    times without calling pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort in between. Thanks to Sebastian
    Marsching from "aquenos GmbH" for this fix.
  </p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for setting the record timestamp from the driver, using a new field,
    pasynUser-&gt;timeStamp. The driver can set this field in read and callback operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fixed a long-standing bug in devAsynXXXArray support for input waveform records
    with SCAN=I/O Intr. The data were being copied to the record without using dbScanLock.
    This meant that the data could change while the record was processing.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the "ring buffer overflow" messages from "ASYN_TRACE_ERROR" to "ASYN_TRACEIO_DEVICE",
    so they do not appear by default. These messages are not really errors, but warnings
    that record processing it not keeping up with the rate of driver callbacks for records
    with SCAN=I/O Intr.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug when adding a parameter that already existed. Thanks to Hinko Kocevar
    for fixing this.</p>
  <h3>
    Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    Added new document "HowToDoSerial_StreamDevice.html".</p>
  <h3>
    Test programs</h3>
  <p>
    Added new test program, testConnectApp. It uses asynPortDriver, and has a polling
    thread that sends a user-defined string to a device and reads the response. It can
    be used to test the behavior when the device is disconnected and then reconnects,
    etc.</p>
  <h3>
    Build system</h3>
  <p>
    Added a rule in asyn/Makefile to fix a problem that could cause parallel make to
    fail.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-19</h2>
    <h2>
      May 21, 2012</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Interfaces</h3>
  <p>
    Added a new interface, asynEnum. This interface is designed to allow drivers to
    set the strings, values, and severities for record enum fields. This can be done
    both at iocInit(), in init_record() with the pasynEnumSyncIO-&gt;read() function,
    and after iocInit via callbacks to device support.
  </p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the new asynEnum interface for bo, bi, mbbo, and mbbi records
    in the asynInt32 and asynUInt32Digital device support. These records now attempt
    to read the initial values of the strings, values (mbbo and mbbi only) and severities
    for the enum fields. They also support callbacks on the asynEnum interface, so that
    enum values can be set dynamically at run-time.</p>
  <p>
    Improved the support for setting the alarm status of records. Previously for records
    that were not I/O Intr scanned STAT was always to READ_ALARM or WRITE_ALARM, and
    SEVR was set to INVALID_ALARM. A new function, pasynEpicsUtils-&gt;asynStatusToEpicsAlarm()
    was added that converts asynStatus values to EPICS alarm values. This allows records
    to have STAT=TIMEOUT_ALARM, DISABLE_ALARM, etc. More values of STAT can be supported
    in the future by adding more values to the asynStatus enum.</p>
  <p>
    Previously it was not possible for input records with SCAN=I/O Intr to have their
    alarm status set at all. This support has been added. Device support now uses the
    pasynUser-&gt;auxStatus field in the pasynUser passed to the callback function.
    If auxStatus != asynSuccess then the record alarm STAT and SEVR are set to values
    based on the asynStatus. asyn port drivers can now signal error status to clients
    in callback functions by setting pasynUser-&gt;auxStatus to asynSuccess, asynTimeout,
    asynError, etc. This change should be backwards compatible with all drivers because
    the pasynUser that is used for the callbacks is private to the callback function,
    and the auxStatus field is initialized to 0, which is asynSuccess.</p>
  <p>
    Added new waveform record device support, asynInt32TimeSeries and asynFloat64TimeSeries.
    These use callbacks from the driver on those respective interfaces to collect a
    time series of values in a waveform record. Added new medm file asynTimeSeries.adl
    for this, and added an example waveform record to testEpics/Db/devInt32.db.</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs that caused crashes if SCAN=I/O Intr was set at iocInit.</p>
  <h3>
    asynDriver and asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for I/O redirection to the "dbior" and "asynPrint" commands.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for the new asynEnum interface described above.</p>
  <p>
    Added support in asynPortDriver for passing status information to clients in callbacks.
    Each parameter in the parameter library now has an associated asynStatus variable.
    New functions setParamStatus() and getParamStatus() are provided to access this
    variable. For example, if setParamStatus(paramIndex, asynError) is called then callParamCallbacks()
    will cause any input records with SCAN=I/O Intr to go into alarm state.</p>
  <p>
    Moved asynPortDriver from the miscellaneous directory to its own directory. Improved
    the internals, but did not change the API. Thanks to John Hammonds for this.</p>
  <h3>
    Other</h3>
  <p>
    Added a new test application, testErrorsApp. This application uses a driver based
    on asynPortDriver to test error handling for all interfaces and all records support
    by the asyn standard device support (asyn/devEpics). It can be used to test error
    handling of records with both periodic scanning and I/O Intr scanning. It also tests
    the new asynEnum interface for setting enum strings, values, and severities at iocInit.</p>
  <p>
    Removed the newline terminator from all messages in pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage.
    This formatting does not belong in the error message. Thanks to Lewis Muir for this.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPServerPort. Added call to epicsSocketEnableAddressReuseDuringTimeWaitState
    which fixes problems when the IOC is restarted and the port is still in TIME_WAIT
    state. Thanks to Lewis Muir for this.</p>

  <p>
    Added titles to EDM screens.</p>
  <p>
    Added CSS BOY screens.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed build problem. It was rebuilding the VXI11 code with rpcgen each time make
    was run, even if nothing had changed.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Cleaned up logic for callbacks on asynUInt32Digital interface. It was not doing
    callbacks if the value had not changed but an interrupt had occured for bits in
    the mask. This would happen when interrupts were only enabled on the falling or
    rising edges but not both. Added an additional form of setUIntDigitalParam that
    takes an interruptMask argument. In the previous releases drivers were calling setUInt32Interrupt
    for callbacks which is not correct. That function should only be called by device
    support to tell the driver which interrupts to recognize. These problems made the
    quadEM not work correctly with the ipUnidig.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Bug fix on WIN32. It was waiting forever when timeout=0 when it should return whatever
    characters are available without waiting at all.</p>

  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed asynRecord.dbd to include promptgroup for fields that need it. Removed the
    SOCK field and asynSocketSetup.adl; the record no longer supports creating sockets,
    which can easily be done with the iocsh drvAsynIPPortConfigure command.</p>
  <p>
    Added IXON, IXOFF, and IXANY fields for new XON/XOFF support on serial ports. These
    fields were added to the asynSerialPortSetup.adl medm screen.</p>
  <h3>
    devAsynXXXArray</h3>
  <p>
    For waveform output records the device support was always writing NELM elements,
    rather than NORD elements.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeCom.c</h3>
  <p>
    Added missing include file, which caused asyn not to build on EPICS base versions
    before 3.14.10.</p>
  <h3>
    vxi11core_xdr.c</h3>
  <p>
    Removed unneeded declarations of 'register int32_t *buf' from many functions. Removed
    register keyword from remaining instances, because address was being taken, which
    is illegal in C, and was causing errors on vxWorks Pentium cross-compiler.</p>
  <h3>
    asynPortDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Added a global function, findAsynPortDriver(const char *portName), that returns
    a pointer to an asynPortDriver object given the asyn port name.</p>
  <p>
    Added 3 new asynPortDriver methods: setUInt32DigitalInterrupt, clearUInt32Interrupt,
    getUInt32Interrupt. These were needed to complete the asynUInt32Digital support.</p>
  <h3>
    asynShellCommands</h3>
  <p>
    The asynOctetSetInputEos, asynOctetSetOutputEos, asynOctetShowInputEos and asynOctetShowOutputEos
    commands now take effect even if the port is not connected. This makes startup scripts
    more robust in the face of devices that are not accessible at IOC startup. Removed
    the unused "drvInfo" parameter from each of these functions.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Host name lookup is now deferred until port connection time. This makes startup
    scripts robust in the face of a device that is offline at IOC startup and has been
    offline for so long that it's DNS entry has been deleted.</p>
  <p>
    Prevent reconnects during IOC shutdown. The IP Port exithandler runs before record
    scanning stops. In that interval, if a record is scanned then it will trigger a
    reconnect, and new connection can be shutdown without sending data, or without waiting
    for a reply. Some embedded TCP/IP stacks have problems dealing with this. Thanks
    to Michael Davidsaver for this fix.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for local serial ports on Windows, i.e.win32-x86 and windows-x64 architectures.
    Previously Windows local serial ports were only supported on the cygwin-x86 architecture.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for serial line software handshake flags (ixon/ixoff/xany) on most
    architectures (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, Darwin, WIN32; see: man stty) and vxWorks (ixon
    only). Thanks to Dirk Zimoch for this.</p>

  <h3>
    asynDriver</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs in connection management. Releases 4-11 through 4-13 had the following
    problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a port was multi-device and auto-connect, and was only accessed using SyncIO
      calls, then asynManager would never connect to the devices. If regular queued requests
      were used, which happens if an asyn record is connected to that port and device,
      then it would connect once the first queue request was done.</li>
    <li>For all auto-connect ports there was a race condition, such that the port might
      or might not be connected when the first queued request or SyncIO call was done
      on that port. This arose because when the port registered its asynCommon interface,
      asynManager queued a connection request on that port. But if that connection request
      callback, which executes in the portThread, had not yet occurred when a queue request
      or SyncIO call was made, then those operations would be rejected because the port
      was not yet connected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These problems were fixed by doing the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the port registers its asynCommon interface and asynManager queues the connection
      request, it now waits for a short time for the connection callback to complete.
      The default time is 0.5 seconds, but this time can be changed with a call to the
      new function pasynManager-&gt;setAutoConnectTimeout(double timeout). This function
      can be accessed from the iocsh shell with the new asynSetAutoConnectTimeout(double
      timeout) command. This short timeout is designed to allow devices time to connect
      if they are available, but not to excessively slow down booting of the IOC by waiting,
      for example, for the system timeout on TCP connections. Note that this change means
      that it is now very likely that the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() call will occur as
      soon as the asynCommon interface is registered. As noted in the R4-12 release notes,
      this means that the driver must have already done all initialization required for
      the asynCommon-&gt;connect() callback before it registers the asynCommon interface!</li>
    <li>There is an additional new function, pasynManager-&gt;waitConnect(asynUser *pasynUser,
      double timeout), which will wait for the for the port to connect, up to the specified
      timeout. This function can be called from the iocsh with the new command asynWaitConnect(const
      char *portName, double timeout). This function makes it possible to wait longer
      for a port to connect then the current value of the global autoconnect timeout described
      above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fixed problems with the SyncIO calls, which were caused by the implementation of
    pasynManager-&gt;lockPort():</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The SyncIO calls (e.g. asynOctetSyncIO) are implemented by calling pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(),
      executing the I/O in the current thread, and then calling pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort().
      These SyncIO functions are designed to be called from threads that are allowed to
      block, such as SNL programs, or other drivers. The problem with the previous implementation
      was that pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() immediately took the port mutex when it was
      available, rather than queueing a request to take the mutex. This could lead to
      one thread effectively getting exclusive access to the port, even if other threads
      had queued requests or tried to do SyncIO calls themselves. For example, if a device
      could send unsolicited input, then one might create a thread that simply called
      pasynOctetSyncIO-&gt;read() with a short timeout in a tight loop. The problem with
      this was that as soon as that thread released the port mutex when the read timed
      out, it would take the mutex again, blocking other threads that were trying to access
      the port.&nbsp; Previously the only solution to this problem was to add a short
      epicsThreadSleep() in the read loop.</li>
    <li>This problem has been fixed by reimplementing pasynManager-&gt;lockPort(), which
      now queues a request to access the port and then blocks until the queue request
      callback runs in the portThread. When the queue request runs, the thread that called
      pasynManager-&gt;lockPort() executes, and the portThread blocks, until pasynManager-&gt;unlockPort()
      is called.</li>
    <li>Note that this change to lockPort() does change its functionality in one respect:
      previously it was OK to call lockPort() on a port that was not connected. This is
      no longer possible, because the queueRequest call in lockPort will now return an
      error if the port is not connected.</li>
    <li>The change to lockPort did not require any changes to the asynXXXSyncIO functions
      except asynCommonSyncIO. The asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice and asynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice
      calls cannot use lockPort() any more, because as noted above it does not work with
      disconnected ports. Rather, these functions now directly queue a connection request
      with a private callback function to connect or disconnect the port.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    vxi11</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug in driver initialization. The driver had not completed all required
    initialization before it called pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort. Because pasynGpib-&gt;registerPort
    registers the asynCommon interface, that now normally triggers an immediate callback
    to vxiConnect, and the driver was not yet properly initialized to handle that callback.</p>
  <p>
    Added an additional example driver, asynPortTest, that uses asynPortDriver. It implements
    the asynInt32, asynFloat64, and asynOctet interfaces to communicate with the echo
    server using asynOctetSyncIO calls. This tests nested SyncIO calls. Added a new
    startup script, database and medm screen for testing this new driver.</p>
  <h3>
    devGpib</h3>
  <p>
    Added a call to asynOctet-&gt;flush() just before the call to asynOctet-&gt;write()
    operation when doing write/read operations. This eliminates any stale input that
    may have already been sent by the device and would otherwise be incorrectly returned
    by the read operation.</p>
  <h3>

  <h3>
    testIPServerApp</h3>
  <p>
    Changed ipEchoServer2.c to eliminate the epicsThreadSleep(0.01) in the listener
    thread. This sleep is no longer necessary because of the change to lockPort described
    above, so the example program was changed to test and demonstrate this.</p>

    A return of 0 from a read of a TCP stream is treated as an END condition rather

    at the end of a reply.</p>
  <p>
    Support has been added for devices such as web servers that require a connect at
    the beginning of each transaction. To enable this behaviour, specify "http" as the
    protocol in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command and ensure that each transaction
    ends with a read that detects the broken connection from the device. Note that the
    device will always appear connected. The connect/disconnect around each transaction
    is handled within the drvAsynIPPort driver.</p>

  <h3>
    devEPICS</h3>
  <p>
    The ring buffer code in devAsynFloat64.c, devAsynInt32.c and devAsynUInt32Digital.c
    has been improved. Previously when ring buffer overflow occurred during a callback
    the new value was simply discarded. This meant that when the record processed at
    the end of a rapid burst of callbacks it would not contain the most recent value.
    Now when overflow occurs the oldest value is removed from from the ring buffer and
    the new value is added, so that the record will contain the most recent callback
    value after a burst.</p>
  <p>
    asynUInt32Digital: asynMask values implying shifts greater than 16 bits are now
    supported.</p>
  <h3>

  <p>
    Fixed bug which caused an error when writing or reading in binary format if the

  <p>
    Added drvInfo strings to parameter lists, and new methods to support this: createParam(),
    findParam(), getParamName(). The report functions now print out the drvInfo strings,
    which is very useful. The base class drvUserCreate() method can now be used without
    reimplementing in derived classes, because the parameter names are now available
    to the base class. Removed asynParamString_T and drvUserCreateParam(), which are
    no longer needed. The testAsynPortDriver test application has been updated to use
    these new features.</p>

  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    A problem was introduced in R4-11 by not starting the autoconnect process until
    iocInit(), and operations that do not use the XXXSyncIO functions thus fail before
    iocInit(). This means, for example, that calls to asynSetOption() to set serial
    port parameters fail if done in a startup script before iocInit(). R4-12 fixes this
    problem by decoupling autoconnect operations from iocInit(). NOTE: The first call
    to the pasynCommon-&gt;connect() function now happens almost immediately after pasynManager-&gt;registerInterface()
    is called for the asynCommon interface. This timing is different from all previous
    asyn releases, and it means that port drivers must initialize everything required
    by asynCommon-&gt;connect() before they register the asynCommon interface. This
    may require minor re-ordering of the initialization sequence in some drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Requests to set end-of-string values or serial port parameters are accepted even
    when the port is not connected. The request takes effect when the port is connected.

    that may be unavailable on startup.</p>

  <p>
    asynReport at detail level 0 now reports only disconnected subaddresses.</p>
  <p>
    The autoconnect code has undergone considerable modification. When a port is registered
    with autoConnect true, or whenever a port disconnect exception is raised on an autoConnect
    port, an attempt at connection occurs immediately followed by retry attempts at
    20 second intervals. Attempts to queue requests to a disconnected port (even an
    autoConnect port) will be rejected. These changes have been made to reduce the occurences
    of 'connection flurries' and to ensure that requests do not languish in the queue
    when connections are broken.</p>
  <p>
    Setting the trace mask or trace I/O mask for a port now also sets the trace mask
    or trace I/O mask for every device associated with that port.</p>
  <p>
    Passing a NULL pasynUser argument to the setTraceMask and setTraceIOMask will set
    the asynBase (default) trace mask or trace I/O mask. To do this from the iocsh pass
    a zero length portName string to the iocsh commands asynSetTraceMask or asynSetTraceIOMask.</p>

    asynOctet</h3>
  <p>
    Ths asynOctet <strong>writeRaw</strong> and <strong>readRaw</strong> methods have
    been removed. In most cases, if your code now calls readRaw or writeRaw it should
    be safe to simply change these calls to their non-Raw equivalent. If you're paranoid
    about someone interposing the end-of-string processing layer you could add something
    like the following to ensure that there is no end-of-string to match:</p>
  <pre>pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);</pre>
  <p>
    If you need to switch to 'raw' mode for a while and then back to 'eos mode', you
    can use code similar to that in devGpib.c:readArbitraryBlockProgramData:</p>
  <pre>char saveEosBuf[5];
int saveEosLen;
.
.
.
status = pasynOctet-&gt;getInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,saveEosBuf,sizeof saveEosBuf,&amp;saveEosLen);
if (status != asynSuccess) {
    epicsSnprintf(pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage,pasynUser-&gt;errorMessageSize,"Device EOS too long!");
    return -1;
}
if (saveEosLen)
pasynOctet-&gt;setInputEos(asynOctetPvt,pasynUser,NULL,0);

  </p>
  <p>
    When compiling your code against this new version of asyn you should pay particular
    attention to warning messages of the form "warning: initialization from incompatible
    pointer type". These are a good indication that you're initializing an <strong>asynOctet</strong>
    structure with the old-style I/O methods.</p>

    Added three new array interfaces, asynInt8Array, asynInt16Array, and asynFloat32Array.
    asynInt8Array and asynInt16Array are the same as asynInt32Array except that the
    data types are for epicsInt8 and epicsInt16 respectively. asynFloat32Array is the
    same as asynFloat64Array except that the data type is for epicsFloat32.</p>
  <p>
    Added asyn(XXX)ArraySyncIO for synchronous I/O to all array interfaces.</p>
  <p>
    Added new asynGenericPointer interface. The datatype for this interface is void*,
    so it can be used to pass a pointer to anything. Includes asynGenericPointerSyncIO
    for synchronous I/O.</p>
  <p>
    Added asynStandardInterfaces.h and asynStandardInterfacesBase.c to simplify driver
    initialization when using the standard asyn interfaces defined in asyn/interfaces
    (common, octet, int32, etc.)</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Undid the change that was done in R4-9 with direct calls to dbScanLock and process
    in the interrupt callback functions. This could lead to deadlocks in some circumstances.
    The original reason for changing from scanIoRequest to (dbScanLock, process) was
    because callback values would be lost if the callbacks came so close together in
    time that the single callback value stored in device support was overwritten before
    scanIoRequest could process the record. This problem has been fixed by adding a
    FIFO (ring buffer) to the device support for the scalar interfaces asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital,
    and asynFloat64. The ring buffer is only created when the record is put into I/O
    Intr scan, so the storage is not allocated for records that are not I/O Intr scanned.
    The ring buffer default size is 10 values, but this can be changed on a per-record
    basis using the dbInfo string "FIFO" with a value such as "100".</p>
  <p>
    Added support for bi and bo records for asynInt32 interface. Previously these records
    were only supported for the asynUInt32Digital interface.</p>
  <p>
    Added waveform record device support for the asynInt8Array, asynInt16Array, and
    asynFloat32Array interfaces. These are the same as devAsynInt32Array and devAsynFloat64Array
    with changes to the data types.</p>

  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Replaced scanIoRequest with direct call to rset-&gt;process in interrupt callback
    routines in all device support. Without this fix if another interrupt occurred before
    the first scanIoRequest was complete bad things could happen. The data from the
    first interrupt would be lost, and the read function in the driver would be called
    when it should not have been.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for 28,800 baud for those architectures which support this unusual
    speed.</p>
  <p>
    Added stub routines for WIN32 so that a separate DBD file is no longer needed.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIpPort</h3>

    <h2>
      April 28, 2007</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    devEpics/devAsynInt32</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for link specification of</p>
  <pre>@asynMask(portName,addr,nbits,timeout)drvParams</pre>
  <p>
    in addition to the previous support for</p>
  <pre>@asyn(portName,addr,timeout)drvParams</pre>
  <p>
    This allows device support to work with drivers that cannot return meaningful values
    in pasynInt32-&gt;getBounds because they do not know the range of the device. This
    is true, for example of Modbus ADCs. The nbits parameter is defined as follows:</p>
  <pre>  nbits &gt; 0  Device is unipolar with a range from 0 to 2^nbits-1
  nbits &lt; 0  Device is bipolar with a range from -2^(abs(nbits)-1) to 2^((abs(nbits)-1)-1
           Values returned on the asynInt32 interface will be sign extended
           using the sign bit (e.g. bit abs(nbits)-1 starting at bit 0).
  </pre>
  <h3>
    devEpics/devAsynInt32Array, devAsynFloat64Array</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for callbacks from driver to device support. This allows waveform
    records to have I/O Intr scanning, as already supported for other records in devEpics.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics/asynEpicsUtils</h3>
  <p>
    Changed parser so it requires an exact match to "asyn(" or "asynMask(". Previously
    it tolerated other characters before the "(", and in particular it accepted "asynMask("
    when "asyn(" was expected. Note that this change could cause problems with database
    files if they did not follow the documented syntax, which has no white space between
    "asyn" or "asynMask" and the "(" character.</p>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Fix errors in format strings for asynPrint.</p>
  <p>
    Temporary fix to asynReport thread for Cygwin. If the amount of output is small
    the thread exists for a very short time, and this causes a crash. The fix is a short
    wait, but it should really be fixed in base/src/libCom/osi/os/posix/osdThread.c.</p>

  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Full support for new timeout semantics (timeout&lt;0 means "wait forever for characters

  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort/drvAsynSerialPort</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed NULL pointer dereference.</p>
  <h3>
    drvAsynIPPort</h3>
  <p>
    Previous versions of drvAsynIPPort.c (1.29 and earlier, asyn R4-5 and earlier) attempted
    to allow 2 things:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use an EPICS timer to time-out an I/O operation, such as send(), recv() and connect().</li>
    <li>Periodically check (every 5 seconds) during a long I/O operation to see if the
      operation should be cancelled.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Item 1) above was not really implemented because there is no portable robust way
    to abort a pending I/O operation. So the timer set a flag which was checked after
    the poll() was complete to see if the timeout had occured. This was not robust,
    because there were competing timers (timeout timer and poll) which could fire in
    the wrong order.</p>
  <p>
    Item 2) was not implemented, because asyn has no mechanism to issue a cancel request
    to a driver which is blocked on an I/O operation.</p>
  <p>
    Since neither of these mechanisms was working as designed, the driver has been re-written
    to simplify it. If one or both of these are to be implemented in the future the
    code as of version 1.29 should be used as the starting point.</p>
  <p>
    If pasynUser-&gt;timeout &lt; 0 an infinite timeout is now used.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug so that ports connected with a file descriptor in pasynUser-&gt;reason
    execute code to set timeouts.</p>
  <p>
    Fixed bug to return error if pasynCommon-&gt;connect is called when port already
    connected.</p>
  <h3>
    asynTrace</h3>
  <p>
    Added two new functions which are related to pasynTrace-&gt;print and pasynTrace-&gt;printIO
    the way vprintf is related to printf.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprint Same as pasynTrace-&gt;print except that instead of a variable
      of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
    <li>pasynTrace-&gt;vprintIO Same as pasynTrace-&gt;printIO except that instead of
      a variable of arguments it takes a va_list argument as its last parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynManager</h3>
  <p>
    Changed pasynManager-&gt;connectDevice for ports which have the properties autoConnect=1
    and isConnected=0. In this case a request is queued to call asynCommon-&gt;connect
    for that port. This ensures that ports that have a pasynUser connected to them will
    report being connected even if no I/O has yet been done. Previously such ports reported
    a disconnected state until the first I/O or operation such as setTraceMask. This
    was confusing.</p>
  <p>
    Clarify documentation on meaning of pasynUser-&gt;timeout. Previously there was
    no documented method of specifying an "infinite" timeout to a driver, and the meaning
    of timeout=0.0 was not defined. The new definitions are:</p>
  <p>
    &gt; 0.0 Wait for up to timeout seconds for the I/O to complete</p>
  <p>
    = 0.0 Peform any I/O that can be done without blocking. Return timeout error if
    no I/O can be done without blocking.</p>
  <p>
    &lt; 0.0 Infinite timeout. Wait forever for I/O to complete.</p>
  <h3>
    devEpics</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed bugs with asynFloat64Average device support. The wrong interrupt function
    was being called, and UDF was not being cleared.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 4-5</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    memMalloc/memFree</h3>
  <p>
    memMalloc was allocating the amount of memory the caller requested rather than the
    amount required for the freeList. If memFree was called and the memory reallocated
    to a user requesting a larger size, memory corruption occured. This is fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    SyncIO routines</h3>
  <p>
    If the connect call fails the asynUser is no longer freed. Instead a message is
    put into asynUser.errorMessage. The caller must call disconnect in order to free
    the storage for the asynUser.</p>
  <p>
    The SyncIO routines no longer call asynPrint if there is an error and there is a
    valid asynUser available. Rather they return an error message in pasynUser-&gt;errorMessage.
    The SyncIO*Once functions still call asynPrint for errors, because they do not have
    a way of returning an error message.</p>
  <h3>
    Serial, TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Handle 0-length write requests.</p>
  <h3>
    TCP/UDP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    Added drvAsynIPServerPort to support TCP and UDP socket servers.</p>
  <p>
    Added iocBoot/testIPServer to test TCP server support.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort now closes TCP sockets when remote system closes connection.</p>
  <p>
    drvAsynIPPort connect function now uses pasynUser-&gt;reason as a file descriptor
    if it is &gt; 0. This allows drvAsynIPServerPort to re-use asyn ports it creates.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort add null byte at end of input if there is room.</p>
  <p>
    Made drvAsynIPPort:readRaw set eomReason to 0. It was not setting eomReason at all
    previously.</p>
  <h3>

  <h3>
    VXI11</h3>
  <p>
    Better support was provided for VXI-11.3 controllers, i.e. talking directly to an
    ethernet port on an instrument. In particular a TDS3054B was tested.</p>
  <p>
    WARNING: The VXI-11.1 ansd VXI-11.3 standards do NOT allow access to GPIB lines,
    i.e. conmmands like Untalk/Unlisten are not possible. The previous support issued
    these commands after each read or write. Some really old GPIB devices may fail.
    If so the device specific code must be modified to sent these commands separately.</p>
  <h3>
    win32</h3>
  <p>
    Changes were made to allow asyn to build on native Windows (win32-x86) architecture.</p>
  <p>
    There are two asyn components that do not yet work on win32-x86.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Local serial ports. The asyn uses the "termios" API for serial ports, and termios
      is not available for native Windows.</li>
    <li>VXI-11. The asyn VXI-11 support uses the Sun XDR API, which is not available for
      native Windows.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Users who want to use local serial ports or VXI-11 on Windows can use the Cygwin
    EPICS build (cygwin-x86).</p>

        An error is returned if blockProcessCallback is called for a synchronous port.</p>
    </li>
    <li>lockPort/unlockPort
      <p>
        These are new asynManager methods. They can be used in place of queueRequest if
        the caller can block. They have been added to make it easier to implement a driver
        with one addressing scheme that is a asynUser of a driver with a different addressing
        scheme. For example a multi-drop serial driver can be implemented that calls a standard
        serial driver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>asynLockPortNotify

    Yevgeny A. Gusev has again reported some hard to recognize bugs. He must have spent
    many hours looking at the code. His extra set of very good eyes are much appreciated!!.
    He also thought of the way to handle support that uses one addressing scheme but
    wants to use support that has a different addressing scheme. For example support
    for mult-drop serial that wants to use the standard serial support</p>

    Changes were made to the way serial port options are handled.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>initial values
      <p>
        Previosly defaults were assigned for all options. Now the initial values are fetched
        from either the termios (POSIX) or sioLib (vxWorks).</p>
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>vxWorks clocal and crtscts
      <p>
        The vxWorks sioLib uses clocal for what POSIX calls crtscts. The new serial support
        for vxWorks accepts both clocal and crtscts to specify RTSCTS (Request to send,
        Clear to send).</p>

    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <p>
    APOLOGY: Many interfaces have changed since release 3-3. This is the reason this
    release is called 4-0.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>asynManager - Only report has changed. Many new methods have been added. asynManager:report
      takes an additional parameter, portName.</li>
    <li>asynOctet - The read/write methods are similar to before. The new version has
      sepearate end of string methods for input and output.</li>
    <li>register based interfaces - Extensive changes have occured.</li>
    <li>devGpib - Unless special conversion routines call low level drivers, debGpib support
      should work without any changes.</li>
    <li>devEpics -
      <ul>
        <li>Extensive changes have occured. The support naming now follows the names of asyn
          interfaces. For example devAsynInt32 contains device support for interface asynInt32.</li>
        <li>device definitions have changed.
          <p>
            Blanks no longer appear in the menu choices. For example.</p>
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,devAiAsynInt32,"asyn Int32")
       </pre>
          is now
          <pre>    device(ai,INST_IO,asynAiInt32,"asynInt32")
       </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynOctetSyncIO
      <ul>
        <li>All read and write methods now return asynStatus and have additional args to return
          the number of bytes sent/received.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>The IEOS and OEOS fields are set to the current values for the port when the record
          connects to the port. If they are modified after the record connects to the port,
          then the EOS strings will be changed using asynOctet-&gt;setOutputEos or asynOctet-&gt;setIbputEos.
          IMPORTANT: The values of IEOS and OEOS in the database file are never used, because
          they are modified when the record connects to the port.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>interrupt support -A major new feature is support for interrupts. See asynDriver.html
      for details.</li>
    <li>linuxGpib - This is support for the linuxGpib open source project. It contains
      support for many linux gpib kernel drivers. The asyn support was provided by Rok
      Sabjan (cosyLab).</li>
    <li>cancelRequest - If cancelRequest is called while either the process or timeout
      callback is active, it now waits until the callback completes.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>Added PCNCT field to connect/disconnect from port, and to indicate if port is
          currently connected.</li>
        <li>Added DRVINFO and REASON fields to provide control for the drvUser interface.</li>
        <li>Added support for register interfaces (asynInt32, asynUInt32Digital, and asynFloat64).
          New I/O fields for this support are I32INP, I32OUT, UI32INP, UI32OUT, UI32MASK,
          F64INP, and F64OUT. The new IFACE field is used to select the currently active interface.</li>
        <li>Added new fields to indicate if a particular interface is supported by the driver.
          These fields are OCTETIV, I32IV, UI32IV, F64IV, OPTIONIV, and GPIBIV.</li>
        <li>Added support for I/O Intr scanning for any driver/interface that supports callbacks.
          asynOctet does not yet support callbacks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 3-3</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Incompatible Changes.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>MAY BE MORE - This release has major new features. Implementing the new features
      may have caused some imcompatibilities, This list is likely to grow as existing
      users report problems.</li>
    <li>queueRequest - If the portDriver does not block then the queue callback is called
      by queueRequest rather than by a separate thread. User code can call canBlock to
      find out how the callback is called.</li>
    <li>registerPort - The argument multiDevice has been replaced by attributes. Attributes
      currently has two bits ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK. The port driver is responsible
      for setting both bits correctly.</li>
    <li>setOption/getOption have been moved from asynCommon to a new interface asynOption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Support for register based drivers.
      <ul>
        <li>Generic register based device support for EPICS records.</li>
        <li>Additional fields have been added to asynUser.</li>
        <li>Added pasynManager-&gt;memMalloc() and pasynManager-&gt;memFree() for allocating
          and freeing memory with a freelist. This is primarily meant to be used with pasynManager-&gt;duplicateAsynUser()
          and the new pasynUser-&gt;userData field.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynDriver.h</h3>
  <p>
    The following changes have been made</p>
  <ul>
    <li>userData - this is a new field in asynUser.</li>
    <li>registerPort - Field multiDevice is replaced by attributes. Currently two attributes
      are defined: ASYN_MULTIDEVICE and ASYN_CANBLOCK.</li>
    <li>duplicateAsynUser - This is a new method that creates a new asynUser and initializes
      it with values from an existing asynUser. freeAsynUser now puts the asynUser of
      a free list rather than calling free.</li>
    <li>memMalloc/memFree - New methods that manage storage. It uses a set of free lists
      of different sizes.</li>
    <li>asynCommon no longer has methods setOption/getOption.</li>
    <li>asynOctet is now defined in a separate header file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    Removed the GOPT field. This is no longer necessary because the port options are
    automatically read whenever connecting to a port. "special" requests are now queued
    without changing the state of the record, using the new duplicateAsynUser, memMalloc(),
    and memFree() methods. This means that there is no longer a possibility of a special
    request being rejected because the record is busy. It is no longer possible to cancel
    a special request.</p>
  <h3>
    asynGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>asynGpibPort:srqStatus returns asynStatus</li>
    <li>asynGpibPort:serialPoll returns asynStatus. It now only calls a registered callback
      only if statusByte&amp;0x40 is non zero.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    devSupportGpib</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>setEos is now a method.</li>
    <li>completeProcess is a new method. This was added to support synchronous drivers.</li>
    <li>Failures for GPIBREADW|GPIBEFASTIW were not handled properly. This could cause
      and assert failure. This is fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    drvAsynSerialPortFlush</h3>
  <p>
    Flushes input only.</p>
  <h3>
    asynInterposeEOS</h3>
  <p>
    The EOS read method now calls the low-level read method only once and returns as
    many characters as the low-level method supplies. This makes the EOS read semantics
    match those of the low-level serial and IP drivers.</p>
  <h3>
    drvVxi11</h3>
  <p>
    vxi11SetRpcTimeout - now handles fractions of a second properly</p>
  <h3>
    asynRecord</h3>
  <p>
    A new field has beem added, AQR (Abort Queue Request)</p>
  <p>
    The semantics have been changed as follows: process is responsible for all and only
    for I/O operations. Only I/O operations cause the alarm status and severity to change.
    Special is responsible for all other operations performed by asynRecord.</p>

      Release 3-2</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE --</strong> The units of the <code>respond2Writes</code>
      field, if greater than 0, are now seconds rather than milliseconds. This change
      was made so that all time values set in the instrument support initialization routine
      are specified uniformly in units of seconds. Very few instrument support files are
      likely to be affected by this change</li>
    <li>The contents of asynRecDevDrv.dbd have been placed in asyn.dbd and asynRecDevDrv.dbd
      has been removed. This allows applications to get correct dbior reports and access
      to asynRecords by including any low-level driver .dbd file.</li>
    <li>The drvAsynTCPPort driver has been renamed drvAsynIPPort since it now supports
      both UDP and TCP protocols. The protocol is selected by adding a "UDP" or "TCP"
      after the "hostname:port" in the drvAsynIPPortConfigure command. A missing protocol
      is taken to be "TCP".</li>
    <li>Work around 'missing SPD' bug in HP E2050 GPIB/LAN adapter. SRQ handling is much
      more robust on all supported hardware.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Major New Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>National Instruments NI1014 VME GPIB interface is now supported.</li>
    <li>GPIB - All low level GPIB support (vxi11, gsip488, and ni1014) now fully support
      the GPIB specific features defined by asynGpibDriver.h</li>
    <li>Implementation of asynTrace is more consistent across the low level drivers.</li>
    <li>Added makeSupport script and template instrument support. Updated tutorials to
      reflect these additions.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 3-1</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Changed and obsolete features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The drvGenericSerial driver has been split into drvAsynSerialPort and drvAsynTCPPort
      drivers for local and remote serial ports, respectively. End-of-string processing
      has been moved to an interposed interface.</li>
    <li>The diagnostic facilities previously provided by asynTrace.db have been replaced
      with the much more general asynRecord.db</li>
    <li>All asynManager,asynCommon, and asynOctet methods except report now return asynStatus.
      Methods that previously returned a different value now have an additional argument
      for this value.</li>
    <li>Low-level driver read and write methods now return asynStatus and are passed an
      additional argument through which they store the actual number of characters read
      or written.</li>
    <li>The createSocket method in the asynSyncIO interface has been replaced by openSocket.
      openSocket does not call asynSyncIO-&gt;connect(), that must now be done by the
      caller.</li>
    <li>Removed code for "flush" from gpib drivers. The implementation caused infinite
      loops on devices that speak when not spoken to.</li>
    <li>asynRecord
      <ul>
        <li>asynOctetRecord has been renamed to asynRecord</li>
        <li>TIOM, TMSK, TSIZ, TFIL, AUCT, ENBL, CNCT, ERRS, TINP, NAWT fields have been added</li>
        <li>Default values of OMAX and IMAX decreased from 512 to 80</li>
        <li>Options that are unknown for a device (e.g. baud on a Moxa terminal server) are
          shown as Unknown.</li>
        <li>Many bug fixes and improvements in logic and functionality</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <ul>
    <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
    <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
    <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>

    <li>Other device support methods especially streams, devSerial, and mpfSerial.</li>
    <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
    <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Testing</h3>
  <p>
    The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris, Linux (redhat
    9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been tested with the following
    vxi11 controllers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
      <p>
        It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
    </li>
    <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
    <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
      <p>
        When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2 rather than a
        VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address. SRQs did not work when
        connecting via the ethernet port but did when communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME carrier.</li>
    <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
    <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
    <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa NPort Ethernet/Serial
      converter.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support: DG535
    and TDS3014B Scope.</p>

<h1>asynDriver: Asynchronous Driver Support - Release Notes</h1>

<h1>April 2004</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>Release 3-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changed and obsolete features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The drvGenericSerial driver has been split into drvAsynSerialPort and
  drvAsynTCPPort drivers for local and remote serial ports, respectively.
  End-of-string processing has been moved to an interposed interface.</li>
  <li>The diagnostic facilities previously provided by asynTrace.db have been
  replaced with the much more general asynRecord.db</li>
  <li>All asynManager,asynCommon, and asynOctet methods except report
   now return asynStatus. Methods that previously returned a different value now
   have an additional argument for this value.</li>
  <li>Low-level driver read and write methods now return asynStatus and
  are passed an additional  argument through which they store the actual number
  of characters read or written.</li>
  <li>The createSocket method in the asynSyncIO interface has been replaced by 
  openSocket.&nbsp; openSocket does not call asynSyncIO-&gt;connect(), that must 
  now be done by the caller.</li>
  <li>Removed code for &quot;flush&quot; from gpib drivers.&nbsp; The implementation 
  caused infinite loops on devices that speak when not spoken to.</li>
  <li>asynRecord<ul>
  <li>asynOctetRecord has been renamed to asynRecord</li>
  <li>TIOM, TMSK, TSIZ, TFIL, AUCT, ENBL, CNCT, ERRS, TINP, NAWT fields have 
  been added</li>
  <li>Default values of OMAX and IMAX decreased from 512 to 80</li>
  <li>Options that are unknown for a device (e.g. baud on a Moxa terminal 
  server) are shown as Unknown.</li>
  <li>Many bug fixes and improvements in logic and functionality</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 2-1</h2>
</center>

<h3>Major New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Connection Management - A framework for connection management is
    provided. It provides the ability to connect/disconnect to/from a port or
    port,addr. It also provides enable/disable and autoConnect/noAutoConnect.
    See the asynDriver for details.</li>
  <li>devAsyn - Generic device support for connect management for a specific
    device.</li>
  <li>devAsynGeneric - Generic support for connection management and
    traceing. This support dynamically attaches to a port,addr. Thus one set
    of records and one medm display can be used for all devices connected to
    an ioc.</li>
  <li>asynOctetRecord - A generic record and medm display that allows
    interactive access to many asynDriver features.</li>
  <li>asynSyncIO - A synchronous interface to asynDriver. This can be used
    by code, e.g. SNC programs, that are willing to wait instead of following
    an asynchronous model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed and obsolete features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>devAsynTrace is replaced by devAsyn and devAsynGeneric.</li>
  <li>asynManager.h
    <ul>
      <li>disconnectDevice has been renamed to disconnect.</li>
      <li>The interface to low level drivers has been drastically modified in
        order to support the new connection management features. See the
        asynDriver documentation for details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>asynGpib
    <ul>
      <li>registerPort has additional arguments multiDevice and
      autoConnect.</li>
      <li>setPortOption,getPortOption are setOption,getOption</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 1-2</h2>
</center>
<ul>
  <li>Promote VXI-11 RPC definition files to vxi11 directory.  Use rpcgen to
    build RPC support files for targets for which this is possible.</li>
  <li>Run rpcgen on Solaris with 'multi-thread' flag.</li>
  <li>Use separate GPIB message/response buffer for each port instance.</li>
  <li>Use sscanf to convert GPIB stringin response.</li>
  <li>Fix race condition in GPIB finish routines.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Release 1-1</h2>
</center>

<p>This release includes support for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>asynTrace - A trace facility is now implemented.</li>
  <li>gsIP488 - The Greensprings Industry Pack IP488 is now supported</li>
</ul>

<p>Modifications include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Added asynSetPortOption and asynGetPortOption to manipulate port
    options.</li>
  <li>Changed serial support to use asynSetPortOption/asynGetPortOption.</li>
  <li>Added devGPIB GPIBCVTIO commmand type to allow custom conversion
    routine to perform all I/O operations.</li>
  <li>Changed rules for return value from devGPIB custom conversion
  routines.</li>
  <li>Added dbior support.</li>
  <li>Changed devGPIB to no longer cache EOS.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Release 1-0alpha2</h2>
</center>

<h3>Support Provided in addition to asynDriver and asynGpib</h3>
<ul>
  <li>devGpib - The Winans/Franksen gpib device support.</li>
  <li>vxi11 - Support for instruments that support the VXI-11 standard.</li>
  <li>drvGenericSerial - Support for devices connected to serial ports or to
    Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Other device support methods especially streams, devSerial, and
    mpfSerial.</li>
  <li>NI1014 VME Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Industry Pack IP488 Gpib driver.</li>
  <li>Successor to GI (GPIB Interact).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>The vxi11 support has been tested on the following platforms: Solaris,
Linux (redhat 9), Darwin, Windows XP (Cygwin), and vxWorks. It has been
tested with the following vxi11 controllers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agilent E2050A LAN/GPIB Gateway.
    <p>It's vxiName must start with "hpib" rather than "gpib".</p>
  </li>
  <li>Agilent E5810A LAN/GPIB Gateway.</li>
  <li>Tektronix TDS3014B Scope.
    <p>When communicating with the Ethernet port it acts like a VXI-11.2
    rather than a VXI-11.3 device. It seems to just accept any GPIB address.
    SRQs did not work when connecting via the ethernet port but did when
    communicating via a LAN/GPIB gateway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The generic serial support has been tested with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>xvWorks with a GreenSprings Octal UART Industry-Pack module on a VME
    carrier.</li>
  <li>Linux and Windows XP (Cygwin) with PC hardware serial port
  (/dev/ttyS0).</li>
  <li>Solaris hardware serial port (/dev/cua/a).</li>
  <li>Linux, Solaris, Darwin, vxWorks, and Windows XP (Cygwin) with a Moxa
    NPort Ethernet/Serial converter.</li>
</ul>
Two Device Support modules have been converted from the 3.13 gpib support:
DG535 and TDS3014B Scope.</body></html>

# CONFIG_SITE

# Make any application-specific changes to the EPICS build
#   configuration variables in this file.
#
# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named

#   CONFIG_SITE.Common.$(T_A)

# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building anyway if conflicts are found.

# Set this when you only want to compile this application
#   for a subset of the cross-compiled target architectures
#   that Base is built for.

# To install files into a location other than $(TOP) define
#   INSTALL_LOCATION here.

# Set this when your IOC and the host use different paths
#   to access the application. This will be needed to boot
#   from a Microsoft FTP server or with some NFS mounts.
# You must rebuild in the iocBoot directory for this to
#   take effect.

# If you have the local Linux GPIB support installed (http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-gpib/)
# then set LINUX_GPIB=YES

# If you have libusb-1.0 revision 16 or newer and want the USB TMC support set DRV_USBTMC=YES
#DRV_USBTMC=YES

# You can also define this on a per-architecture basis.  
# In this example DRV_USBTMC would be built only for linux-x86_64, and not for other architectures

# If you want to build asyn so the only dependency on EPICS base is libCom then set the following flag

# CONFIG_SITE

# Make any application-specific changes to the EPICS build
#   configuration variables in this file.

# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named

#   CONFIG_SITE.Common.$(T_A)

# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building anyway if conflicts are found.

#   for a subset of the cross-compiled target architectures
#   that Base is built for.

# To install files into a location other than $(TOP) define
#   INSTALL_LOCATION here.

# Set this when your IOC and the host use different paths
#   to access the application. This will be needed to boot
#   from a Microsoft FTP server or with some NFS mounts.

# If you want to build asyn so the only dependency on EPICS base is libCom then set the following flag

# Some linux systems moved RPC related symbols to libtirpc
# To enable linking against this library, uncomment the following line
